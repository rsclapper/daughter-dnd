**Guard's Status**: Suspicious, weapon ready, calling for backup

---

## **BARD'S CHARM PERSON ATTEMPT**

### The Charm
**Target**: City Guard on rooftop
**Spell**: Charm Person
**Approach**: Appeal to guard's sense of local pride/favoritism

**Bard's Persuasion**: "Wait! You should let us go - we're the favorite adventuring party in town!"

### **GUARD'S RESPONSE - CHARMED**

**Guard's Reaction** (affected by charm, sees party as friendly):

*The guard's stern expression softens as the magical charm takes hold. He blinks in confusion for a moment, then his face breaks into a genuine smile.*

**"Oh! Well, why didn't you say so from the start!"**

*He sheathes his sword and chuckles warmly.*

**"I should have recognized you lot! Everyone's been talking about your exploits around the taverns. The whole city's been buzzing about how you handled that situation at [previous adventure location]."**

*He steps aside and gestures toward the building gap.*

**"Listen, I don't know what all that commotion was about down there, but I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding. You folks have done more for this city than most of the regular guard!"**

*He winks conspiratorially.*

**"I'll tell the others I lost track of you in the smoke. These old buildings, you know how it is - easy to lose someone in all those shadows and alleyways. Just... maybe try to keep the property damage to a minimum next time, eh?"**

*He gives a friendly salute.*

**"Safe travels, heroes. The city's in your debt."**
