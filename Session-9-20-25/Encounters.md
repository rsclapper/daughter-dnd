### Location Description
**Copper Coin Alley** is a narrow service passage between two three-story buildings. The alley is 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, paved with uneven cobblestones slick with moisture. Flickering lanterns hang from iron brackets, casting dancing shadows that seem to move independently. Wooden crates and barrels are stacked along the wallsâ€”some containing grain, others empty and dry as tinder.

The buildings on either side have boarded-up windows at ground level, and rusty fire escapes zigzag up the brick facades. A persistent smell of damp wood and old ash hangs in the air. When the encounter begins, an unnatural chill precedes the arrival of the supernatural enemies.

### Battlefield Hazards & Tactics
- **Round 1**: Ember Shades emerge from shadows near crates (E1/E2), Wraith materializes in center
- **Round 2**: Wooden crates start smoldering (difficult terrain)
- **Round 3**: Fires spread, creating 10-ft radius heavily obscured areas
- **Round 4+**: Smoke begins filling alley, imposing disadvantage on ranged attacks

**Tactics:**
- **Ember Shades**: Use Shadow Step to flank, target spellcasters
- **Mirror Wraith**: Stays central, uses Reflection Strike when focused
- **Environmental**: Enemies try to drive party into burning areas
