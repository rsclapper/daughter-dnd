# Entering the Cursed March
*The party crosses the threshold into distorted reality*

## **CROSSING THE BOUNDARY**

### **The Moment of Entry**

*Read aloud:*

*As you step across the invisible line marked by the ancient stone boundary marker, the world... shifts. It's subtle at first - a slight dizzy sensation, like stepping off a boat onto solid ground. But then you notice the details that don't quite fit.*

*The sun overhead seems to cast shadows in multiple directions. The grass beneath your feet feels solid enough, but when you look closely, some blades appear to be growing downward into the sky. The air tastes of copper and old memories.*

*Behind you, the normal world looks strangely distant, as if viewed through thick glass. The stone marker you just passed now bears different runes than it did moments ago - symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.*

*The Codex's whispers, which had been urgent but unintelligible, suddenly become... not clearer, exactly, but more insistent. You can almost understand what it's trying to tell you.*

## **IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE MARCH**

### **Disorientation Check**

*Each party member must make a **Constitution saving throw (DC 13)** to resist the initial disorientation of entering the March.*

**Success**: Character adapts quickly to the strange environment
**Failure**: Character suffers one level of exhaustion until the next rest

### **Codex Reaction**

*The artifact pulses with warm light, and its whispers take on a rhythmic quality, almost like a heartbeat. The map fragment becomes noticeably warm and occasionally glows faintly, pointing steadily north toward Embercross.*

### **Environmental Observations**

**Time Distortion**: *Watches and timepieces begin running erratically*
**Direction Confusion**: *Compass needles spin wildly*
**Sound Anomalies**: *Echoes arrive before the original sounds*
**Visual Disturbances**: *Distant objects appear closer or farther than they should*

## **THE PATH FORWARD**

### **Stone Marker Navigation**

*True to Willem's advice, the ancient stone markers provide the only reliable navigation. Each weathered pillar stands about 8 feet tall and bears runic inscriptions that seem to remain stable while everything else shifts.*

*The path between markers is clearly defined - a worn trail that feels more solid and "real" than the surrounding landscape.*

### **First Marker Inscription**

*The runes on the boundary marker now read (in Common, somehow):*

**"Those who seek the First Flame's truth must walk the path of echoes. What was, what is, and what might be converge where the Emberkeepers fell."**

*Below this, fresher scratches in the stone warn:*
**"Turn back - the convergence has begun. The Nine awaken. - Scholar Valdris, 1247"**

## **MARCH ENCOUNTER 1: THE ECHO PHENOMENON**

### **First Hour of Travel**

*After an hour of walking along the marker path, you begin to notice something unsettling. Occasionally, you catch glimpses of other travelers on the same path - but they're translucent, like reflections in water.*

*These "echo travelers" seem to be walking the same route at different times. Some appear to be from decades ago based on their clothing and equipment. Others look more recent, and a few... look like they might be from the future.*

### **The Merchant Caravan Echo**

*One of the most distinct echoes is a familiar sight - Gareth's merchant caravan, the same one you encountered yesterday. But this version looks different. The wagons are burned and overturned, the guards are missing, and Gareth himself appears to be searching frantically through the wreckage.*

*He can't see or hear you, but you can clearly hear his echo voice:*

**"The potions! Where are the healing potions? We'll never make it without them!"**

*This echo-Gareth begins counting his supplies and realizes exactly three healing potions are missing. He looks around in confusion and growing panic.*

### **The Scholarly Expedition Echo**

*Another echo shows a group of four scholars in academic robes, carrying surveying equipment and taking careful notes. Their leader, a woman with graying hair, points ahead excitedly:*

**"The convergence point should be just ahead! Think of what we'll learn about the original Calamity!"**

*But this echo has a tragic ending - as you watch, the scholarly group suddenly ages rapidly, their hair turning white, their backs bending, until they collapse into dust that the wind carries away.*

### **Your Own Echo**

*Most disturbing of all, you occasionally catch glimpses of yourselves - but different versions. In one echo, you see yourselves fleeing in terror from something behind you. In another, one of your party members is missing. In a third, you appear to be carrying multiple glowing artifacts instead of just the one Codex.*

## **NAVIGATIONAL CHALLENGE**

### **The Split Path**

*At the second major stone marker, the path splits into three directions. Each route has its own marker with different inscriptions:*

#### **Left Path - "The Path of Memory"**
*Rune Translation*: **"Here lie the echoes of what was. Walk among the shadows of history, but do not linger, lest you become one yourself."**

*Visible along this path*: *More intense echo phenomena, ghostly structures, sounds of long-past events*

#### **Center Path - "The Path of Presence"**
*Rune Translation*: **"The road between moments, where now is always fleeting. Trust your senses, but know they may deceive."**

*Visible along this path*: *The most direct route, but reality seems to shift constantly - trees that weren't there moments ago, rocks that move when not observed*

#### **Right Path - "The Path of Possibility"**
*Rune Translation*: **"See what might be, should choices change. But beware - some futures seek to make themselves real."**

*Visible along this path*: *Glimpses of potential futures, some promising, others terrifying. The path itself seems to change based on your intentions*

### **Codex Guidance**

*The Codex reacts differently to each path:*
- **Left Path**: Whispers become melancholy, almost mourning
- **Center Path**: Steady, rhythmic pulsing - this feels like the most direct route
- **Right Path**: Excited, agitated whispers, as if anticipating something

### **Time Pressure**

*While you deliberate, you notice the sun hasn't moved in the sky since you entered the March. Time is definitely distorted here, but you can't tell if you're moving faster or slower than normal time.*

*In the distance, you can see more of those searching lights beginning to move, still far away but definitely active.*

## **DECISION POINT**

**Current Status**:
- **Location**: Second major stone marker in the Cursed March
- **Time**: Indeterminate (sun hasn't moved)
- **Party Condition**: [Based on CON save results]
- **Codex**: Active and responsive to different paths
- **Threats**: Distant searching lights, echo phenomena
- **Navigation**: Must choose between three distinct paths

**Each path offers different challenges and revelations:**
- **Memory Path**: Historical insights but risk of getting lost in the past
- **Presence Path**: Most direct but constantly shifting reality
- **Possibility Path**: Future knowledge but risk of dangerous prophecies becoming real

**Which path does the party choose, and how do they prepare for the unique challenges ahead?**
