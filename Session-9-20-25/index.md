Perfect. Let’s set the stage with an immersive **intro monologue/narration** followed by a **Session 1 module** that includes timeline, encounters, and narrative beats.

## 🎙️ Campaign Intro Monologue: *“Embers of Vexler”*

> *"When the vault door slammed shut behind you, the world should’ve forgotten you. But fate—fickle, flame-kissed, and ever watching—had other plans."*
>
> *"You came seeking gold, artifacts, maybe a good story. But what you found was older than the city, deeper than the tunnels, and hotter than any forgefire. You emerged with more than loot… you brought back the **Flamebound Codex**—and it noticed."*
>
> *"Now the city breathes differently. The wind tastes like ash. Statues whisper in the night. Flowers bloom where fire once danced. And shadows—shadows stare too long."*
>
> *"What you opened was not just a vault. It was a wound."*
>
> *"Vexler stands, unaware it has already begun to burn. And you? You’re holding the match."*

## 📖 Session 1 Module: *“Ashes in the Air”*

### 🎯 Objective

### 🧭 Locations

#### 🛏️ Hideout (Safehouse, Tavern, or Sewer Den)

* Passive Codex effects cause warmth, whispering in dreams.
* Long rest triggers one player’s **vision** of a burning city and a vault splitting open.
* Glyphs briefly etch into walls or skin.

#### 🏘️ Vexler Market District

* Strange gossip: a statue weeps molten bronze.
* Blacksmith claims his **forge hissed in fear** when the party walked by.
* A local mage offers to “safeguard” the Codex for a steep price.

---

### 🧩 Codex Mystery Events (Optional Inserts)

* **Codex Pulse** (when held too long):
  *Roll CON save DC 13.* On fail, hallucinations of flame serpents.
  On success, glimpses of glyphs that **glow when danger is near**.

* **Message from Codex** (at night):
  “**Nine vaults. One flame. Many hands.**”
  Optional rune puzzle appears in mid-air if someone casts *Comprehend Languages*.

### ⚔️ Combat Encounter: **“The Burning Mirror”**

**Trigger**: Party tries to leave district or opens the sealed box.

* **Opponents**:

  * 2× **Ember Shades** (shadowy humanoids with molten edges)
  * 1× **Flamebound Mirror Wraith** (a mimic that mimics player attacks once it reflects them)

* **Battlefield**: Cramped alley, lanterns flickering, crates catching fire mid-fight.

* **Twist**: The wraith screams **one of the PC’s names** in a haunting, glitchy tone.

---

### 🕵️ NPC Hooks

#### 🧓 Professor Maellin (arcane historian)

* Claims the Codex is a **legend tied to the Ember Archive**, a society that vanished 100 years ago.
* Offers to help decode it—but may have his own agenda.

#### 🎭 The Bard (if alive)

* Sends word via a courier:
  *“I’m in Embercross. Found something… or it found me. Come quickly.”*
