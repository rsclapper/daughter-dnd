### The Offer
*After the party settles into their warded room, Seraphine approaches with a knowing smile.*

*She leads you to a concealed section behind a false wall, revealing a surprisingly well-stocked armory.*

**"Everything here is clean—no questions asked, no stolen goods heat. Well, mostly clean."** *She winks.* **"I keep prices fair for people who bring me interesting business."**

## **UNDERGROUND ARMORY - "THE CACHE"**

### Description
*The hidden chamber contains racks of weapons, sets of armor, and shelves lined with adventuring gear. Everything appears to be in excellent condition, with many items showing the telltale shimmer of minor magical enhancement.*

**"My suppliers include retired adventurers, estate sales, and the occasional... career change donation,"** *Seraphine explains.* **"Quality guaranteed, and I throw in basic maintenance for free."**

## **SERAPHINE'S SURVIVAL ADVICE**

*As she hands over the Druid's bow, Seraphine leans in conspiratorially.*

**"About the Cursed March - here's what most travelers don't know:"**

**"Time gets... slippery there. A day's walk might take three days, or you might cover three days in an hour. Don't trust your normal sense of direction or distance."**

**"The wildlife is... unusual. Not hostile, exactly, but changed. Don't eat anything that glows, don't drink from water that runs uphill, and if you see your own reflection in a tree trunk, look away immediately."**

**"Most importantly - stick together. Groups that split up in the March have a nasty habit of ending up in different decades."**

*She straightens up with a grin.*

**"But hey, at least you'll have proper gear when you get there!"**

---

## **SHOPPING COMPLETE**

**Seraphine surveys the well-equipped party with satisfaction.**

**"You're looking much more prepared for whatever comes next. The warded room is yours until noon tomorrow - get some rest. In the morning, I'll have fresh intelligence on city watch movements and the best routes out."**

**"Oh, and don't worry about the Codex overnight. Those ward stones will keep it quiet - no supernatural tracking while you sleep."**

*She begins closing up the armory.*

**"Sweet dreams, and try not to burn down my establishment like you did that inn."**

---

**The party is now well-equipped and ready to rest safely. What do they want to do for the remainder of the evening before getting a full night's sleep?**
