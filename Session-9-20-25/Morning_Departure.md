## **SERAPHINE'S MORNING BRIEFING**

*You wake to the smell of strong coffee and herb smoke. Seraphine is waiting in the main chamber with a hot breakfast and fresh intelligence.*

### **City Watch Update**
**"The watch is still buzzing about last night. Here's what I've learned:"**

- **Inn Investigation**: Magical investigators confirmed "supernatural incident"
- **Manhunt Status**: Active search for "four individuals of interest"
- **Watch Deployment**: Heavy presence at main gates and known safe houses
- **Timeline**: Investigation expected to continue for 2-3 days

### **Recommended Escape Route**
*Seraphine spreads out a detailed map on the table.*

**"Your best bet is the Merchant's Gate on the east side. Guard rotation changes at mid-morning - that's your window."**

**"I've arranged a contact there - tell the gate guard you're 'delivering mushrooms to Farmer Hendricks.' He'll wave you through without the usual documentation checks."**

### **Travel Intelligence**
**"Three day journey to Embercross if you push hard and the roads cooperate. Here's what you need to know:"**

#### **Day 1: Imperial Road (Safe)**
- **Distance**: 25 miles north
- **Terrain**: Well-maintained road, regular patrols
- **Overnight**: Village of Millbrook (last civilized stop)
- **Supplies**: Final chance to resupply before the March

#### **Day 2-3: The Cursed March (Dangerous)**
- **Distance**: "30 miles" (could be 10 or 100 depending on conditions)
- **Terrain**: Twisted landscape, reality distortions
- **Hazards**: Time slips, strange creatures, navigational confusion
- **Navigation**: Follow the ancient stone markers - they're more reliable than compass

#### **Final Approach: Embercross Ruins**
- **Status**: Abandoned for centuries, supernatural taint
- **Dangers**: Unknown - no recent intel available
- **Preparation**: Whatever you're going to face, you'll face it there

## **DEPARTURE SCENE**

### **At the Merchant's Gate**

*The morning sun casts long shadows as you approach the eastern gate of the city. Following Seraphine's instructions, you time your arrival for the guard rotation change. The area is busy with legitimate merchants and farmers heading out for the day's business.*

*A stocky guard with graying temples approaches as you near the checkpoint. His eyes briefly scan your group before settling on the Rogue.*

**"Morning travelers. State your business beyond the walls."**

*The coded phrase about mushrooms works perfectly - the guard's expression relaxes and he waves you through without the extensive documentation checks other travelers are receiving.*

**"Safe travels. Watch yourselves on the northern roads - been reports of strange weather patterns."**

---

## **THE JOURNEY BEGINS**

### **First Hour on the Imperial Road**

*The relief of leaving the city behind is palpable. The Codex, quiet overnight in the warded room, begins its familiar whispers again as you put distance between yourselves and the urban wards. The ancient artifact seems... eager, somehow, as if it knows you're heading toward its origin.*

*The Imperial Road stretches north before you, a testament to engineering from a more prosperous age. Stone mile markers bear weathered inscriptions, and the occasional patrol of road wardens ensures relative safety.*

*After an hour of travel, you crest a small hill and see the city sprawling behind you, smoke still rising from the district where last night's "incident" occurred.*

---

## **RANDOM ENCOUNTER - FELLOW TRAVELERS**

### **The Merchant Caravan**

*Around midday, you encounter a merchant caravan heading south toward the city. Three covered wagons escorted by a handful of guards make slow progress along the road.*

*The lead merchant, a portly man with worry lines etched deep in his face, raises a hand in greeting as you approach.*

**"Travelers heading north? You might want to reconsider your route."**

### **Disturbing News**

*The merchant's name is Gareth Moss, and his news is troubling:*

**"We came down from Millbrook this morning. Strange things happening up that way - folks report seeing lights in the sky over the Cursed March, and there's been... sounds. Like singing, but wrong somehow."**

**"Lost two horses yesterday - just vanished from their tethers overnight. Found strange ash where they'd been standing."**

**"The village headman's talking about sending word to the capital, requesting an investigation. Whatever's stirring up north, it's got everyone spooked."**

### **Trading Opportunity**

*Despite his nervousness, Gareth is still a merchant:*

**"If you're determined to continue north, I've got supplies that might help. Final chance to stock up before things get... unpredictable."**

#### **Available from Caravan:**
- **Rations (10 days)**: 2 gp *(emergency travel food)*
- **Holy Water**: 25 gp *(might be useful against supernatural threats)*
- **Silver-dusted Rope**: 15 gp *(50 feet, effective against certain creatures)*
- **Compass (Dwarven-made)**: 30 gp *(more reliable in magically disturbed areas)*
- **Healing Potions**: 50 gp each *(standard 2d4+2)*

---

## **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**

### **The Information Changes Things**

*As Gareth's caravan disappears south, you're left with unsettling news:*

1. **Supernatural Activity**: Increasing around Embercross
2. **Missing Animals**: Mysterious disappearances with ash remains
3. **Strange Phenomena**: Lights and otherworldly sounds
4. **Timeline Pressure**: Activity seems to be escalating

### **Party Options:**

#### **Continue as Planned**
- **Pro**: Follow the map fragment's guidance directly
- **Con**: Walking into obviously dangerous supernatural activity
- **Risk**: High - but may be necessary

#### **Gather More Information in Millbrook**
- **Pro**: Learn more about current conditions before entering the March
- **Con**: Delays arrival, might allow enemies to track you
- **Risk**: Medium - balanced approach

#### **Seek Alternative Route**
- **Pro**: Avoid the obviously dangerous direct path
- **Con**: May not lead to answers you need
- **Risk**: Unknown - could be worse than direct route

#### **Turn Back and Seek the Professor**
- **Pro**: Expert help with Codex suppression
- **Con**: Return to city where you're wanted
- **Risk**: High legal consequences, supernatural tracking continues

---

## **THE CODEX'S REACTION**

### **Growing Urgency**

*As you discuss options, the Codex's whispers become more insistent. While still unintelligible, there's an unmistakable sense of urgency, as if the artifact itself is urging you toward Embercross despite the dangers.*

*The map fragment grows warm in your pack, and for a moment, the route to Embercross glows more brightly on the parchment.*

### **Supernatural Awareness**

*Those sensitive to magic notice something else: the Codex seems to be... responding to something. Its power fluctuates in a rhythm, like a heartbeat, as if it's sensing something calling to it from the north.*

---

## **IMMEDIATE DECISION REQUIRED**

**Current Status:**
- **Location**: Imperial Road, 6 hours from city, 2 hours from Millbrook
- **Time**: Early afternoon
- **Weather**: Clear but getting cooler
- **Supplies**: Adequate for several days
- **Information**: Confirmed supernatural activity at destination

**The party must decide:**

1. **Continue to Millbrook for information gathering**
2. **Purchase supplies from the caravan and continue**
3. **Change course entirely**
4. **Press on immediately without delay**

---

## **PARTY'S CHOICE: BUY SUPPLIES & PRESS ON**

### **Legitimate Purchase**
**Items Bought**:
- **2x Rations (10 days each)**: 4 gp total
- **Paid by**: Paladin (budget: 41 → 37 gp)

*Gareth nods approvingly at the practical purchase.*

**"Smart thinking. Twenty days of rations should see you through whatever delays the March throws at you."**

### **Covert Theft Operation**

*While the Paladin conducts the open transaction, the Rogue spots an opportunity. Gareth's attention is focused on counting coin and discussing travel advice, while his guards are watching the road for threats rather than monitoring their own cargo.*

**Stealth Check**: **SUCCESS** - Unnoticed theft

**Items Stolen**:
- **3x Healing Potions** (2d4+2 healing each)
- **Value**: 150 gp worth of goods
- **Detection**: None - theft goes completely unnoticed

*The Rogue smoothly palms three potion vials from a partially opened crate while appearing to simply stretch and look around casually. The theft is expertly executed and completely undetected.*

---

## **TRANSACTION COMPLETE**

### **Party Inventory Gained**:
✅ **20 days of rations** (2x 10-day supplies)
✅ **3x Healing Potions** (stolen, 2d4+2 healing each)

### **Cost**:
- **Legitimate**: 4 gp (paid by Paladin)
- **Illicit**: 0 gp (150 gp value stolen undetected)

### **Remaining Gold**:
- **Paladin**: 37 gp

---

## **DEPARTURE FROM CARAVAN**

### **Gareth's Parting Words**

*As the transaction concludes, Gareth offers final advice:*

**"You seem like capable folks, but be extra careful in the March. Whatever's happening up there, it's unlike anything the old-timers have seen before."**

**"If you do make it to the ruins and back, stop by my shop in Westgate when you return. I'd pay good coin for a firsthand account of what you find."**

*He doesn't notice anything amiss as his caravan continues south toward the city.*

### **Successful Deception**

*The theft goes completely undetected. The merchant and his guards have no idea three valuable healing potions are missing. By the time they might discover the shortage, the caravan will be many miles away and the party's trail will be cold.*

---

## **CONTINUED JOURNEY NORTH**

### **Afternoon Progress**

*With supplies secured and your choice made, you continue north along the Imperial Road. The stolen potions provide a significant safety boost for the dangerous journey ahead.*

*The afternoon passes uneventfully as you make good time on the well-maintained road. The Codex's whispers continue their insistent rhythm, and the map fragment pulses with warm light whenever you check your direction.*

### **Approaching Millbrook**

*As the sun begins to sink toward the western horizon, you see smoke rising ahead - the cooking fires of Millbrook village. This will be your last chance for civilized shelter before entering the Cursed March.*

*The village appears nervous - more guards than usual patrol the perimeter, and you notice several families with packed wagons apparently preparing to leave.*

---

## **MILLBROOK VILLAGE ARRIVAL**

### **Village Status**

*Millbrook is clearly on edge. The normal evening bustle is replaced by hushed conversations and worried glances toward the north. Several buildings show signs of hasty fortification, and the village militia is obviously on high alert.*

### **Options in Millbrook**

#### **The Weary Traveler Inn**
- **Status**: Open but nervous
- **Rooms**: 5 gp per night (premium due to tension)
- **Information**: Nervous locals with firsthand accounts
- **Risk**: Might be recognized from city manhunt

#### **Camp Outside Village**
- **Status**: Free but exposed
- **Safety**: Village guards nearby but not protected
- **Information**: Limited
- **Risk**: Supernatural activity in area

#### **Push Through to the March**
- **Status**: Enter Cursed March at dusk
- **Advantage**: Avoid potential recognition
- **Disadvantage**: Night travel through dangerous territory
- **Risk**: High supernatural danger

### **Local Intelligence Available**

*Villagers are eager to share what they know:*

- **Strange Lights**: Visible nightly over the March for past week
- **Animal Behavior**: Livestock refusing to graze near northern edge
- **Missing Travelers**: Two groups failed to return from north
- **Sounds**: Otherworldly singing heard on still nights
- **Time Distortions**: Reports of lost time and rapid aging

---

## **IMMEDIATE DECISION POINT**

**Current Status**:
- **Time**: Late afternoon/early evening
- **Supplies**: Well-stocked (20 days rations, 3 healing potions)
- **Information**: Confirmed escalating supernatural activity
- **Village**: Nervous but could provide shelter/intel
- **Codex**: Growing more insistent as you approach the March

**Party must choose**:
1. **Stay at inn overnight** - comfort and information, but recognition risk
2. **Camp outside village** - free shelter, limited intel, some protection
3. **Press on into the March** - avoid delays but enter dangerous area at night

---

## **PARTY'S CHOICE: CAMP OUTSIDE VILLAGE**

### **Evening Camp Setup**

*The party decides to make camp in a small grove about half a mile from Millbrook's perimeter. Close enough to benefit from the village's protective presence, but far enough to avoid unwanted attention or recognition.*

*You find a defensible position among some ancient oak trees, with good sight lines and multiple escape routes. The sounds of the nervous village drift faintly on the evening breeze.*

### **Camp Security Measures**

**Watch Schedule Established**:
- **First Watch (Dusk to Midnight)**: [Assign character]
- **Second Watch (Midnight to 3 AM)**: [Assign character]
- **Third Watch (3 AM to Dawn)**: [Assign character]
- **Final Watch (Dawn to Breaking Camp)**: [Assign character]

**Defensive Preparations**:
- **Perimeter**: Natural barriers of thick undergrowth
- **Warning System**: Emergency whistles from Seraphine
- **Escape Routes**: Multiple paths identified
- **Codex**: Kept in center of camp, covered to muffle whispers

---

## **EVENING INTELLIGENCE GATHERING**

### **Villager Contact**

*Around the campfire's dim light, a nervous young farmer named Willem approaches your camp. He's been watching for travelers and seems eager to share information.*

**"You folks heading north? Please tell me you're not planning to enter the March..."**

### **Willem's Account**

*Willem provides crucial firsthand intelligence:*

**Recent Events (Past Week)**:
- **Night Sounds**: *"Like singing, but... wrong. Makes your teeth ache to hear it."*
- **Lost Animals**: *"Found my prize bull this morning - nothing left but ash in the shape of where he stood."*
- **Time Strangeness**: *"My neighbor aged ten years in one night. Says he was only gone for an hour."*
- **The Lights**: *"Dancing flames in the sky, moving in patterns. Almost like they're... searching."*

**Practical Warnings**:
- **Don't Trust Distances**: *"The old stone markers are the only reliable navigation."*
- **Avoid the Singing**: *"If you hear it, cover your ears and move away fast."*
- **Never Split Up**: *"Groups that separate... some folks come back different."*
- **Dawn/Dusk Worst**: *"Most dangerous times - that's when reality gets... thin."*

### **Additional Village Intelligence**

*Willem shares what the village council has learned:*

- **Missing Groups**: Merchant caravan and scholarly expedition both vanished
- **Refugee Reports**: Few survivors describe "walking through memories"
- **Official Response**: Capital has been notified, investigators coming next week
- **Evacuation Plans**: Half the village preparing to leave tomorrow

---

## **NIGHT ENCOUNTERS**

### **First Watch - Distant Phenomena**

*During first watch, the sentry notices strange lights on the northern horizon - exactly as Willem described. Dancing flames that move in deliberate patterns, sweeping back and forth as if searching.*

*The Codex responds to these lights, its whispers becoming more agitated when the flames are visible.*

**Observation Check Results**:
- **Lights**: Definitely supernatural, about 10-15 miles north
- **Pattern**: Systematic search grid, methodical
- **Duration**: Active for approximately 2 hours
- **Codex Reaction**: Increased activity when lights are brightest

### **Second Watch - Village Patrol**

*Village guards make their rounds, passing within 200 yards of your camp. They're clearly nervous, jumping at shadows and speaking in hushed, urgent tones.*

*Snippets of overheard conversation:*
- *"...tell the captain we need more men..."*
- *"...should evacuate the children first..."*
- *"...hasn't been this bad since the old days..."*

### **Third Watch - The Singing**

*Around 3 AM, the wrongsounding singing Willem warned about drifts faintly from the north. Even at this distance, it's unsettling - a harmony that doesn't quite fit together, voices that seem to overlap impossibly.*

*The sentry must make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 12)** or feel compelled to investigate the sound.*

**Save Results**:
- **Success**: Resists compulsion, wakes party to warn them
- **Failure**: Begins walking north, party must intervene

### **Dawn Watch - Final Preparations**

*The final sentry witnesses the sunrise, which reveals the full scope of what lies ahead. To the north, the landscape itself looks... wrong. Colors that don't quite match, shadows that fall in impossible directions, and a faint shimmer in the air like heat distortion.*

*The Cursed March awaits.*

## **MORNING DEPARTURE PREPARATIONS**

### **Party Status After Rest**

**Rest Quality**: Despite the eerie surroundings, the party manages adequate rest
- **Hit Points**: Fully recovered from previous day's travel
- **Spell Slots**: All restored
- **Daily Abilities**: Refreshed (Flame cloak, Emberward bracers ready)

### **Final Equipment Check**

**Current Inventory**:
✅ **20 days of rations**

✅ **Shortbows and arrows** (Bard, Druid)
✅ **Emergency whistles and map**
✅ **Glyph-Burned Dagger** (+1, fire damage)
✅ **Cinderleaf Vial** (fire resistance)

### **Willem's Final Warning**

*As you break camp, Willem appears one last time:*

**"If you absolutely must go north, remember - trust the stone markers, ignore the voices, and whatever you do, don't let the March separate you. Those who enter together must leave together, or not at all."**

**"And if you find anything... anything that explains what's happening up there... please send word back. The village needs to know."**

---

## **APPROACHING THE CURSED MARCH**

### **The Boundary**

*An hour's walk north of your camp, you reach the edge of the Cursed March. The boundary is unmistakable - a line where normal countryside simply... stops. Beyond it, the landscape shifts subtly, as if viewed through water.*

*An ancient stone marker stands at the boundary, weathered but still bearing faint runic inscriptions. The map fragment grows warm in your pack, and the Codex's whispers become urgent.*

### **Final Decision Point**

*Standing at the threshold, you can see the path ahead - ancient stone markers stretching into the distance, leading toward the ruins of Embercross somewhere beyond the distorted horizon.*

*The supernatural lights from last night are no longer visible, but you can feel their presence like a pressure in the air. Whatever is searching the March knows you're coming.*

**Party Status at Boundary**:
- **Preparation**: Complete
- **Information**: Warnings received and understood
- **Supplies**: Adequate for extended journey
- **Resolve**: [To be determined]

**The Cursed March awaits. Do you step across the boundary into the realm where reality bends and time flows strangely?**
