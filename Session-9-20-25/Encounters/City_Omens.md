# City Omens - Environmental Storytelling

## Overview
As the Ember Codex's influence grows, Vexler itself begins to show signs of supernatural change. These omens serve as atmospheric elements, investigation opportunities, and subtle warnings about the growing power of the artifact.

## Market District Manifestations

### The Weeping Statue
**Location**: Central fountain in Market Square
**Description**: *The bronze statue of Vexler's founder appears to be weeping—not tears, but thin streams of molten bronze that cool into delicate golden threads on its cheeks.*

**Investigation Opportunities**:
- **DC 12 Perception**: The metal is warm to the touch despite the cool air
- **DC 15 Investigation**: The molten bronze forms tiny runic patterns as it cools
- **DC 18 Arcana**: The statue is acting as a magical focus, channeling ambient energy

**Witness Reactions**:
- **Local Priest**: "In forty years of tending this shrine, I've never seen anything like it"
- **Nervous Merchant**: "Started three days ago, right after those strange lights in the sky"
- **Street Child**: "The statue whispers at night when no one's listening"

### Korren's Reactive Forge
**Location**: Ironwright's Forge
**Description**: *The blacksmith's forge has been behaving strangely—the flames turn blue-white at unexpected moments, and the metal seems to work itself when no one is watching.*

**Korren's Account**: *"Been smithing for forty years, and my forge has never acted like this. Yesterday I left a sword blade cooling, came back to find it had somehow hammered itself into a perfect edge. The fire hissed when those strangers walked by—actually hissed, like it was afraid."*

**Investigation Results**:
- **DC 13 Investigation**: Scorch marks in unusual patterns around the forge
- **DC 16 Arcana**: The forge is responding to magical radiation from a nearby source
- **DC 18 Insight**: Korren is more frightened than he's letting on

### The Flower Vendor's Anomaly
**Location**: Marta's Flower Stall
**Description**: *Despite the approaching winter, several varieties of flowers are blooming out of season—and they appear to be naturally resistant to flame.*

**Marta's Confusion**: *"Never seen anything like it! These winter roses should have died weeks ago, but they're blooming stronger than ever. And look—"* (She holds a candle near a bloom; it doesn't even singe) *"Fire won't touch them!"*

**Investigation Options**:
- **DC 14 Nature**: These varieties are typically found near volcanic regions
- **DC 16 Arcana**: The flowers are absorbing fire-based magical energy
- **DC 18 History**: Similar flowers were mentioned in old accounts of the Ember Archive

## Residential District Signs

### Shadow Behavior
**Description**: *Throughout certain neighborhoods, shadows seem to move independently of their sources, always pointing toward the same general direction—wherever the party currently is.*

**Manifestation Timeline**:
- **Morning**: Subtle, requires DC 18 Perception to notice
- **Afternoon**: More obvious, DC 15 Perception
- **Evening**: Clearly unnatural, automatic notice

**Witness Accounts**:
- **Elderly Woman**: "My shadow pointed the wrong way all morning, no matter where I stood"
- **Child**: "The shadows are playing follow-the-leader with something invisible"
- **Merchant**: "Bad for business when customers' shadows make them nervous"

### Temperature Anomalies
**Description**: *Certain buildings and areas remain unnaturally warm, with no apparent heat source.*

**Affected Locations**:
- **The Sleeping Dragon Inn**: Guests don't need blankets despite autumn chill
- **Copper Coin Alley**: Where Tika will meet them—noticeably warmer than surrounding streets
- **Professor Maellin's Shop**: Books that should be cold to the touch are room temperature

**Investigation Results**:
- **DC 12 Investigation**: Heat seems to radiate from below ground
- **DC 15 Arcana**: Magical energy is warming these specific areas
- **DC 18 History**: Matches descriptions of "fire-touched" locations from old records

## Harbor District Anomalies

### Water Temperature

**Dock Worker Reports**:
- "Fish are acting strange—swimming in circles near the warm spots"
- "Water's warm enough for a bath in some places, freezing cold in others"
- "Saw lights under the water last night, moving in patterns"

## Investigation Rewards

### Successful Pattern Recognition
**Multiple Omens Investigated (DC 16 Investigation)**:
*"The pattern is clear—all these manifestations are connected to a central source of fire-based magical energy. The effects are radiating outward from multiple points, but they're all growing stronger simultaneously."*

### Arcane Understanding
**Multiple Arcana Checks (DC 18 total)**:
*"This isn't random magical overflow—it's a network awakening. Each artifact is strengthening the others, and the rate of change is accelerating exponentially."*

### Historical Context
**Multiple History Checks (DC 15 total)**:
*"These exact phenomena were described in accounts of the Ember Archive's final days. If the pattern holds, the city has days, not weeks, before the situation becomes critical."*
