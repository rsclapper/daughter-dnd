# Tika's Warning - Social Encounter

## Opening Description

*The halfling smuggler emerges from behind a stack of crates, her movements quick and nervous. Tika's usually confident demeanor is replaced by barely contained panic. Her eyes dart constantly between the alley entrances as she approaches, one hand resting on the hilt of her blade.*

*"Thank the gods you came," she whispers urgently, pressing a sealed wooden box into [nearest PC's] hands. "We need to talk, and we need to talk fast. Someone's been using your names, your descriptions, your reputation. And now there are people—dangerous people—asking questions about all of us."*

*She glances over her shoulder again, then fixes you with a desperate stare. "Whatever you did, wherever you went after our last job... it stirred up a hornet's nest."*

- **DC 12 Insight**: She's genuinely terrified, not lying about the danger
- **DC 15 Insight**: She knows more about who's been asking questions than she's saying

## Potential Complications

### During the Meeting (Roll d6)
1. **Flameguard Patrol**: Appears at alley entrance (see Flameguard_Encounter.md)
2. **Eavesdropper**: Cult informant listening from fire escape (DC 16 Perception to notice)
3. **Codex Reaction**: Pulses with energy, alerting supernatural enemies nearby
4. **City Watch**: Regular patrol, easily fooled but wastes time
5. **Street Thief**: Attempts to pickpocket during conversation
6. **No Complication**: Meeting proceeds smoothly

### If Combat Breaks Out
- **Tika's Reaction**: Uses smoke bomb and flees (won't abandon party if they've been kind)
- **The Box**: At risk of being damaged in combat (explosion on critical hit)
- **Location**: This is where the Burning Mirror encounter triggers

---

## Possible Outcomes

### Information Gained
- **Minimal Success**: Party learns they're being hunted, gets the box
- **Moderate Success**: Learns about Flameguard involvement, gets escape route info
- **Major Success**: Gets contacts in other cities, Tika remains as ally

### Relationship with Tika
- **Hostile**: She flees immediately, may betray their location if captured
- **Neutral**: Completes the handoff, disappears from their lives
- **Friendly**: Offers ongoing support, potential future missions
- **Allied**: Agrees to help actively, joins them temporarily

### The Box Decision
- **Keep It**: Potential weapon, but dangerous to carry
- **Give It Back**: Tika appreciates this, improves relationship
- **Examine It**: Could learn about glyph magic, but risks explosion
- **Destroy It**: Eliminates threat, but loses potential resource

- If Flameguard arrives or other threats appear
- If party tries to detain Tika against her will
- If the box is accidentally triggered

### To Investigation

### To Flight
- If Tika convinces them to leave the city
- If the threat level becomes too high
- If they decide discretion is the better part of valor
