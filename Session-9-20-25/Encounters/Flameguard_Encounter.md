# Flameguard Patrol - Law Enforcement Encounter

## Opening Description

*The steady clank of metal on cobblestone announces their approach before you see them. Around the corner comes a patrol of three figures in red and gold tabards, their armor gleaming despite the overcast day. The leader—a broad-shouldered human with intense amber eyes—surveys the street with military precision while his two younger companions follow in disciplined formation.*

*Sergeant Korvik's gaze sweeps across the market stalls and passes over your group... then stops. His eyes narrow slightly as he takes in your appearances, and his hand unconsciously moves to rest on his sword hilt.*

*"Citizens," he calls out in an authoritative voice that carries clearly across the street. "A moment of your time, if you would."*
