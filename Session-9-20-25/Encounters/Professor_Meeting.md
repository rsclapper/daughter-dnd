# Professor's Offer - Social Encounter

## Opening Description

*The bell above the door chimes as you enter "Maellin's Manuscripts," a cramped shop filled floor-to-ceiling with books, scrolls, and the musty smell of old parchment. Professor Maellin looks up from his reading desk, adjusting his wire-rimmed spectacles. His eyes immediately focus on [PC carrying the Codex], and a spark of intense interest crosses his scholarly features.*

*"Ah, visitors! How fortuitous," he says, rising from his chair with barely contained excitement. "I was just reading about some fascinating historical anomalies—magical disturbances in the city's past. But I sense you may have something far more... immediate to discuss."*

*He approaches slowly, his gaze never leaving the Codex if it's visible. "That aura you carry... it's quite remarkable. Quite familiar, in fact."*

## Information Revealed

### Successful Persuasion (DC 15+)
*"The Ember Archive wasn't destroyed—they performed what they called the 'Great Binding.' Nine artifacts were separated and hidden to prevent... something catastrophic. Your Codex is one of them. If someone is collecting them again..."*

### Successful Investigation (DC 18+)
*Discovery of a letter: "The flame grows stronger with each recovered piece. My contacts in Embercross report similar disturbances. We must act before the binding fails entirely."*

### Showing Trust (Revealing Codex)
*"By the gods... it's real. The theoretical energy patterns, the glyph structure—this is the genuine article. But if you have this, then the others..." He pales. "You're in far more danger than you realize."*
