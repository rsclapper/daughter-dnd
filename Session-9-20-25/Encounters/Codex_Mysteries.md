# Codex Mysteries - Supernatural Events

## Overview
The Ember Codex is not a passive artifact—it actively responds to its environment, the bearer's emotional state, and proximity to other magical forces. These events serve to advance the plot, provide information, and create atmosphere throughout the session.

## Morning Vision

### Opening Description
*As [chosen PC] stirs from sleep, the boundary between dream and waking blurs. The familiar surroundings of your safe house fade, replaced by a vision of Vexler as seen from high above. The city burns—not with destructive fire, but with a golden radiance that flows through its streets like liquid light.*

*At the heart of this vision stands a massive vault, its doors split wide open like a gaping wound. From within pours forth a torrent of flame that doesn't destroy but transforms everything it touches. Stone becomes crystal, iron becomes gold, and the people... the people change too.*

*The vision shifts, zooming toward the vault's interior where eight pedestals stand empty, their surfaces cracked and blackened. Only one remains intact, holding an object that pulses with familiar energy—another Codex, but different from yours. Older. Hungrier.*

*You wake with the taste of ash on your tongue and the sound of distant chanting in your ears.*

### Mechanical Effects
- **Chosen PC**: Gains one-time advantage on Investigation checks related to vaults or Codices
- **Information Revealed**: There are other Codices, they're connected, and something is awakening them
- **Atmosphere**: Establishes the cosmic scope of the threat

## Codex Pulse Events

### Trigger Conditions
- **Held for 10+ minutes continuously**
- **During moments of high stress or emotion**
- **When in proximity to Flamebrand agents or artifacts**
- **In locations with strong magical residue**

### The Pulse Experience
*The Codex grows warm in your hands, its leather binding seeming to pulse like a heartbeat. The glyphs on its cover begin to glow with inner fire, and for a moment, you can swear you hear whispers in a language that predates common speech.*

**CON Save DC 13:**
- **Failure**: Hallucinations of flame serpents for 1 minute (disadvantage on Perception checks)
- **Success**: Glyphs glow faintly when danger is within 30 ft (lasts 1 hour)

### Specific Pulse Triggers
1. **Near Flameguard**: Codex becomes hot to the touch, warns of pursuit
2. **Near Professor Maellin**: Resonates with his hidden Flamebrand texts
3. **In Combat**: Glyphs flare brightly, might blind enemies (DC 12 CON save)
4. **Near Other Magic**: Reacts to magical items or spells being cast

## Night Message

### Setup
*As evening settles over the city and the party finds a moment of quiet, the Codex begins to behave strangely. Its pages flutter open on their own, revealing text that wasn't there before—glyphs that write themselves in lines of golden fire across the parchment.*

### The Message
*"Nine vaults. One flame. Many hands seek what was sundered. The binding weakens with each joining. Beware the mirror's hunger—it seeks to reflect what cannot be contained."*

### Additional Information (If Comprehend Languages is Cast)
*The glyphs rearrange themselves, forming a crude map that hangs in the air above the book. It shows the outline of a region with nine points of light—three are dim (sealed vaults), five pulse slowly (empty vaults), and one burns bright red (current location). An arrow points northeast toward a pulsing orange dot labeled with glyphs that translate to "Fire's First Child"—the direction of Embercross.*

### Mechanical Benefits
- **Map Knowledge**: Party learns approximate locations of other vaults
- **Timeline Pressure**: Understands that time is running out
- **Next Destination**: Clear pointer toward Embercross and the bard

## Environmental Manifestations

### Glyph Manifestations
Throughout the session, glyphs briefly appear on surfaces near the Codex bearer:

**On Walls**: *Ancient symbols etch themselves into stone or wood, glowing for a few seconds before fading*
- **DC 15 Arcana**: Recognizes them as binding runes
- **DC 18 History**: Connects them to pre-imperial magical traditions

**On Skin**: *Temporary tattoo-like marks appear on the bearer's arms or hands*
- **Duration**: 1 hour per manifestation
- **Effect**: +1 bonus to saves against fire damage while visible
- **Social Impact**: DC 12 Perception for others to notice, may cause suspicion

**On Metal Objects**: *Weapons and armor near the bearer show brief runic engravings*
- **Temporary Enhancement**: +1 to hit or AC for 10 minutes
- **Frequency**: Once per combat encounter
- **Warning**: Flameguard agents recognize these markings

### Heat Aura
**Passive Effect**: 5-foot radius around bearer is noticeably warmer
- **Mechanical**: No damage, but detectable
- **Stealth Impact**: DC +2 to stealth checks in cold environments
- **Social Impact**: People unconsciously gather near bearer in cold weather
- **Blacksmith Reaction**: Korren's forge "hissing in fear" is due to this aura

## Interaction Events

### When Examined Closely
**DC 15 Investigation**: *The text within seems to shift and change when you're not looking directly at it. New passages appear while others fade, as if the book is rewriting itself.*

**DC 18 Arcana**: *The magical aura isn't just preservation—it's active communication with something else. The book is part of a larger magical network.*

**DC 20 History**: *Some of the symbols match architectural details from the oldest parts of Vexler, suggesting the city was built around or over something important.*

### When Touched by Multiple People
*If two or more party members touch the Codex simultaneously, they briefly share a vision of the original Ember Archive—robed figures performing a desperate ritual as something massive and fiery pounds against magical barriers from the other side.*

**Shared Knowledge**: All participants learn that the original separation was an emergency measure, not a planned division.

### When Exposed to Fire
*Normal flames bend toward the Codex as if drawn by magnetism. The fire doesn't harm the book but instead seems to feed it—the glyphs glow brighter and new text appears briefly in the flames themselves.*

**Fire Writing**: Messages in Common that provide cryptic warnings:
- *"The Captain's hand bears our mark"*
- *"Three cities burn in sequence"*
- *"The silver gate opens only once"*

## Stress Reactions

### During Combat
- **Round 1**: Glyphs pulse with initiative
- **Round 3**: Brief flash that might blind nearby enemies (DC 12 CON save)
- **If bearer drops to 0 HP**: Codex releases protective burst (1d4 temp HP to all allies within 10 ft)

### During Social Encounters
- **High-stakes conversation**: Provides advantage on Insight checks against deception
- **When threatened**: Glows visibly, potentially revealing its presence
- **Near other Codex seekers**: Becomes almost painfully hot to carry

### During Rest
- **Dreams**: All party members have connected dreams about fire and vaults
- **Long Rest**: Bearer regains one additional hit point per level
- **Nightmares**: If stressed, bearer may have disturbing visions requiring WIS saves

## Progressive Revelation

### Session 1 Level
- **Basic Awareness**: Codex is magical and connected to others
- **Simple Reactions**: Heat, glowing, basic warnings
- **Initial Communication**: Single message about nine vaults

### Future Development Hints
- **Growing Sentience**: More complex communications
- **Active Powers**: Spells castable through the Codex
- **Network Effects**: Interaction with other Codices when found
- **Corruption Risk**: Overuse might change the bearer

## GM Usage Notes

### Pacing the Reveals
- Start subtle with heat and occasional glowing
- Escalate to clear warnings during dangerous encounters
- Save major revelations (night message) for dramatic moments
- Don't overwhelm players with too many effects at once

### Player Agency
- Let players choose how much to investigate vs. ignore
- Reward curiosity with additional information
- Don't force interactions—let them be discoveries
- Allow players to develop their own theories

### Mechanical Balance
- Benefits should feel meaningful but not overpowered
- Drawbacks (heat, visibility) should create interesting choices
- Don't let the Codex solve problems—let it provide tools and information
- Keep the mystery alive—answer some questions while raising others

### Foreshadowing
- Use Codex events to hint at future plot developments
- Plant clues about other factions and locations
- Suggest the larger scope without overwhelming current session
- Build atmosphere for the growing supernatural threat
