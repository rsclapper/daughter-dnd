# The Burning Mirror - Combat Encounter

## Opening Description

*As you [trigger event], the temperature in the alley suddenly drops. Your breath becomes visible in the frigid air, and the flickering lanterns begin to dim. The shadows on the walls start moving independently of their sources, writhing like living things.*

*From the deepest patches of darkness, two humanoid shapes emerge—their forms wavering between solid and smoke, with molten cracks running along their silhouettes like veins of lava. In the center of the alley, the air itself begins to shimmer and twist, coalescing into a translucent, mirror-like entity that hovers three feet off the ground.*

*The lead shade turns its hollow, ember-filled eye sockets toward [PC with Codex] and speaks in a voice like crackling flames: "The flame... calls to us. Return what was taken, and your suffering ends quickly."*

*Roll for initiative.*

## Location Details
**Copper Coin Alley** is a narrow service passage between two three-story buildings. The alley is 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, paved with uneven cobblestones slick with moisture. Flickering lanterns hang from iron brackets, casting dancing shadows that seem to move independently. Wooden crates and barrels are stacked along the walls—some containing grain, others empty and dry as tinder.

The buildings on either side have boarded-up windows at ground level, and rusty fire escapes zigzag up the brick facades. A persistent smell of damp wood and old ash hangs in the air.
