# Underground Refuge - Option 2 Chosen
*The party seeks aid from the city's criminal underworld*

---

## **OPENING SCENE - "The Wounded Jackal"**

*Read aloud to players:*

---

### **Finding the Underground**

*Your wounds ache and the Codex's whispers grow more insistent as you navigate the twisting alleyways of the Lower District. The Rogue's contacts from previous... ventures... lead you through a maze of narrow passages that most citizens would never discover. After twenty minutes of careful movement through shadows, you arrive at what appears to be a dead-end alley.*

*The Rogue approaches a seemingly blank section of brick wall and taps out a specific rhythm: tap-tap... pause... tap-tap-tap. A small viewing slot slides open, revealing a pair of suspicious eyes.*

*"Kai's friends," the Rogue whispers the password.*

*The slot snaps shut, and moments later, a hidden door swings inward, revealing a dimly lit staircase descending into the earth. The scent of herb smoke, old wine, and something medicinal wafts up from below.*

*"Welcome to The Wounded Jackal," comes a gravelly voice from the shadows. "Leave your troubles at the door, but bring your coin."*

## **THE WOUNDED JACKAL - UNDERGROUND SAFE HOUSE**

### Description
*As you descend into the underground establishment, you find yourself in a surprisingly spacious chamber carved from the living rock beneath the city. Oil lamps cast dancing shadows across rough stone walls lined with alcoves containing everything from healing supplies to stolen goods. The air is thick with the smoke of various herbs—some for healing, others for... recreational purposes.*

*Several figures occupy the space: a pair of cutthroats sharing a bottle in one corner, a cloaked figure hunched over ancient texts, and what appears to be a fence examining a collection of jewelry. All eyes briefly assess your group before returning to their own business—the unspoken rule of the underground is that everyone minds their own affairs.*

*Behind a makeshift bar constructed from stolen church pews and topped with a massive piece of marble (likely from a nobleman's tomb), stands the establishment's proprietor.*

## **NPC INTRODUCTION: SERAPHINE "THE NEEDLE" VOSS**

### Physical Description
*The woman behind the bar is perhaps forty-five years old, with silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid. Her left arm is covered in intricate tattoos that seem to move in the lamplight—closer inspection reveals they're actually surgical diagrams and anatomical charts inked into her skin. She wears a leather apron over dark clothing, and her fingers are stained with various alchemical substances.*

*Most striking are her eyes: one natural green, the other a prosthetic made of what appears to be crystallized amber with tiny gears visible within it. A thin scar runs from her temple to her jaw on the same side as the artificial eye.*

### Background
- **Former Identity**: Seraphine was once a battlefield surgeon for a mercenary company
- **The Fall**: Discharged after refusing to let wounded enemies die—considered "too soft" for military medicine
- **Current Role**: Underground healer, information broker, and fence for magical items
- **Reputation**: Known for her surgical skills, alchemical knowledge, and strict neutrality
- **The Eye**: Lost her original eye to a cursed artifact; the replacement allows her to see magical auras

### Personality
- **Professional**: Treats healing as a business transaction, but takes pride in her work
- **Curious**: Fascinated by magical phenomena and rare artifacts
- **Neutral**: Doesn't judge clients, but expects payment and discretion
- **Protective**: The Wounded Jackal is sanctuary—violence here means permanent banishment

## **INITIAL INTERACTION**

### Seraphine's Opening Dialogue

*Seraphine looks up from grinding something in a mortar and pestle, her mechanical eye whirring as it focuses on your group. She takes in your smoke-stained clothes, the various wounds, and—most importantly—the faint magical aura emanating from your belongings.*

**"Well, well. Look what the night dragged in."**

*She sets down her work and approaches, her natural eye studying your injuries while the mechanical one seems to be examining something else entirely.*

**"You lot have the look of people who've had a very interesting evening. Smoke damage, minor burns, exhaustion... and unless my eye deceives me,"** *she glances meaningfully at whoever carries the Codex,* **"you're carrying something that's practically singing with magical energy."**

*She crosses her arms and leans against the bar.*

**"Now, I run a simple business here. I fix people, I move goods, and I share information—all for the right price. The question is: what exactly do you need, and what are you willing to pay for it?"**

*Her mechanical eye continues to whir softly as it tracks the Codex.*

**"Though I have to say, it's been a long time since I've seen an artifact with that kind of... presence. Makes a girl curious about where you've been and what you've gotten yourselves into."**

**"The safe room first, then we talk about your... glowing friend there. Follow me."**

---

## **THE SAFE ROOM**

### Description
*Seraphine leads you through a narrow corridor carved from stone to a heavy wooden door reinforced with iron bands. She produces an ornate key and unlocks it, revealing a surprisingly comfortable chamber.*

*The room contains four simple but clean beds, a small table with chairs, and a washbasin. Most importantly, strange symbols are carved into the stone walls and filled with what appears to be silver. A faint magical hum emanates from these markings.*

**"Ward stones,"** *Seraphine explains, tapping one of the symbols.* **"Prevents scrying, magical tracking, and most divination magic. Anyone trying to find you magically will get... static. You'll be invisible to supernatural senses while you're in here."**

*She hands you the key.*

**"The room is yours until noon tomorrow. Don't lose the key—I charge extra for replacements."**

---

## **CODEX RESEARCH SESSION**

### Seraphine's Analysis

*Back in the main chamber, Seraphine clears a space on her bar and gestures for you to place the Codex. Her mechanical eye begins to glow with a soft amber light as she examines it.*

**"Well, I'll be damned. Haven't seen one of these since my mercenary days..."**

*She carefully doesn't touch the artifact, but circles it slowly, her prosthetic eye clicking and whirring.*

**"This is a Fragment of the Nine—one of the original Flame Codices from before the Great Calamity. Pre-Empire, pre-everything we know today."**

### What She Reveals

*She pulls out a worn leather journal and flips through pages covered in sketches and notes.*

**"The story goes like this: A thousand years ago, there was an order called the Emberkeepers. They were the original wielders of flame magic—not the crude fire spells we know today, but something far more powerful. They could manipulate the very essence of creation itself."**

*Her finger traces a diagram showing nine flame-like symbols.*

**"They created nine Codices, each containing a fragment of the First Flame—the primordial fire that supposedly sparked all magic. But something went wrong. Badly wrong."**

### The Calamity Connection

*Seraphine's expression grows serious.*

**"The Emberkeepers tried to reunite all nine Codices in a ritual called the Great Convergence. Instead of ascending to godhood like they hoped, they nearly destroyed the world. The magical catastrophe that followed is what we call the Great Calamity."**

*She points to a faded map in her journal.*

**"Embercross was their main stronghold. When the ritual failed, the backlash turned it into a cursed wasteland. That's why it's been abandoned for centuries."**

### Current Danger

*Her mechanical eye focuses intently on the Codex.*

**"But here's the thing—your Codex is waking up. I can see the power building inside it, responding to supernatural threats. That's why those creatures attacked you. The more active it becomes, the easier it is to track."**

*She leans forward, speaking quietly.*

**"There are groups out there still trying to collect all nine Codices. The Flamebrand cult is one of them, but they're not the only ones. If word gets out that you have an active Fragment..."**

*She doesn't finish the sentence, but the implication is clear.*

### Practical Advice

**"My advice? You have three options:"**

**"One: Get to Embercross fast. There might be answers there—ways to control or hide the Codex's power."**

**"Two: Find a way to suppress its awakening. I might know someone who could help with that, but it would cost you."**

**"Three: Use it. The Codex chose to awaken in your presence for a reason. It might be trying to help you survive what's coming."**

*She closes her journal.*

**"Whatever you choose, don't stay in one place too long. Every hour that thing gets stronger, you become easier to find."**

## **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE**

### If Asked About Embercross
**"Three days' hard ride north and east. The old Imperial Road will take you most of the way, but the last stretch... that's through the Cursed March. Strange things happen there—time moves differently, reality gets... flexible. Take supplies for a week, not three days."**

### If Asked About the Flamebrand
**"Fanatics who worship the idea of the Great Convergence. They think reuniting the Codices will make them gods instead of destroying everything. They've got cells in most major cities and aren't shy about using force."**

### If Asked About Suppression
**"There's a scholar in the University District—Professor Caelynn Thorne. She specializes in artifact containment. Expensive, but she might be able to build you a suppression field. Course, getting to her without being detected..."** *She shrugs.*

### If Asked About Other Codices
**"Rumors, mostly. One supposedly ended up in the Royal Treasury. Another was last seen in the hands of a dragon collector down south. The rest? Could be anywhere. Could be destroyed. Could be waiting for the right moment to wake up like yours did."**

*She grins, her mechanical eye glinting.*

**"Just don't make me regret it."**
