## **NARRATIVE MONOLOGUE**

*Read aloud to players:*

### **"The Codex Awakens"**

*The cool night air hits your faces as you finally drop down from the rooftops into a quiet alley several blocks away from the inn. Behind you, the orange glow of lanterns and the distant shouts of the city watch fade into the urban maze of narrow streets and shadowed doorways.*

*As you catch your breath in the relative safety of the alley, the Codex—still clutched tightly in [Character]'s hands—pulses with an eerie, rhythmic light. The supernatural battle seems to have awakened something within the ancient artifact. Where once its whispers were barely audible to the one who carried it, now all four of you can hear them clearly, like voices speaking in a language just beyond comprehension.*

*The map fragment you recovered from the burning remnants of the Mirror Wraith materializes before your eyes, its fiery letters spelling out a clear path: **"Embercross - Where the First Flame Was Stolen."** The writing hovers in the air for a moment before settling onto a piece of parchment, the ink still warm to the touch.*

*Around you, the city continues its nightly rhythm, unaware that supernatural forces have just clashed in one of its inns. But you know this is far from over. The entities that attacked you tonight weren't random—they were hunting the Codex specifically, and their master, whoever commands such creatures, now knows exactly where you are.*

*The question that weighs on all your minds is no longer whether you're being hunted—it's how long you have before the next attack comes, and whether you'll be ready for it.*
