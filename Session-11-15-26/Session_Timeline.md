## Time Management Tips

### Running Behind? (Falling more than 15 min behind)
**Scene to Cut/Shorten**:
1. ✂️ **Victory Ceremony** (5 min instead of 15)
2. ✂️ **Travel Scene** (skip encounter, 15 min instead of 30)
3. ✂️ **Antechamber** (skip, go straight to Seal Chamber)

**Combat Acceleration**:
- Assassins retreat at Round 4
- Guardian yields at 50% HP
- NPC allies help in combat

### Running Ahead? (More than 15 min ahead)
**Scenes to Expand**:
1. ➕ **Free Time** (more shopping/roleplay)
2. ➕ **Travel** (add full encounter)
3. ➕ **Seal Exploration** (all three chambers in detail)
4. ➕ **Guardian** (Phase 2, tougher fight)

### Critical Time Checks
- ⏰ **4:00 PM** (1 hour in): Should be in Council Meeting
- ⏰ **5:40 PM** (Before break): Should be wrapping up combat
- ⏰ **7:00 PM** (After dinner): Should be traveling or arriving
- ⏰ **8:30 PM** (30 min left): Should be in Guardian fight
- ⏰ **8:55 PM** (5 min left): Start wrapping to cliffhanger

---

## Break Management

### Break #1 (5:00-5:15 PM)
**Before Break**:
- End on cliffhanger: "As you sleep, outside the window, a shadow moves..."
- Give players 5-minute warning
- Tell them: "Come back ready for COMBAT"

**During Break**:
- Set up combat map
- Review enemy stats
- Organize initiative cards
- Bathroom, snacks, water
- Return at 5:15 PM sharp

### Dinner Break (6:30-6:45 PM)
**Before Break**:
- End on decision: "You've learned Varn is behind this. Time to act."

- Tell them: "Come back ready for the FINALE"

**During Break**:

### Managing Player Lateness
**If someone returns late from break**:

- Start without them, they catch up
- Keep session momentum

---

## Pacing Philosophy

### The Golden Rule
**Better to end 15 minutes early than 30 minutes late**
- Respect the 9:00 PM end time
- Families have bedtimes, work tomorrow
- End strong, not exhausted

### Scene Priority (Cannot Cut)
1. ✅ **Council Meeting** - Core decision
2. ✅ **Assassination Attempt** - Combat & Varn reveal
3. ✅ **Seal Puzzle** - Lore & decision
4. ✅ **Guardian Fight** - Climax

### Scene Priority (Can Shorten/Cut)
1. ✂️ Victory Ceremony (nice but optional)
2. ✂️ Free Time (can be brief)
3. ✂️ Travel Scene (montage it)
4. ✂️ Investigation (just give them evidence)

### Keep Combat Moving
**Tools**:
- ⏲️ **Turn Timer**: 1 minute per turn
- 📊 **Pre-rolled Initiative**: Save 2 minutes
- 🎲 **Digital Dice**: Faster than physical
- 📱 **Calculator**: Quick math

**If Combat Drags**:
- "You have 30 seconds to decide"
- Roll attacks and damage together
- NPCs act on same initiative
- Describe outcomes quickly, move on

---

## DM Energy Management

### Your Energy Matters
**6 hours is a marathon, not a sprint**

**Energy Peaks** (Use for big moments):
- 3:30-4:30 PM: Council Meeting (you're fresh)
- 5:15-6:00 PM: Assassination (post-break energy)
- 8:00-9:00 PM: Guardian Fight (final push)

**Energy Dips** (Keep it simple):
- 4:30-5:00 PM: Free time (players lead)
- 6:00-6:30 PM: Investigation (straightforward)
- 6:45-7:15 PM: Travel (montage it)

### Stay Hydrated & Fed
- Water bottle at DM screen
- Snack during breaks
- Eat real dinner at 6:30 PM break
- Caffeine at 7:00 PM if needed

### Voice Care
- Don't shout unnecessarily
- Vary voices but don't strain
- Drink water between scenes
- Use music to create mood (save your voice)

---

## Success Metrics

### You've Done Well If:
✅ All major scenes happened
✅ Party made their Council choice
✅ Both combats occurred
✅ They reached the Fractured Seal
✅ Guardian fight happened
✅ Ended by 9:05 PM
✅ Players are excited for next session

### Don't Stress If:
❌ You cut Victory Ceremony
❌ Travel was brief
❌ Combat took different time than expected
❌ Players made unexpected choices
❌ Pacing wasn't perfect

**Remember**: Fun matters more than perfect timing!

---

## Emergency Contingencies

### If Total Party Knockout (TPK)
**Assassination Attempt**:
- Assassins steal Codices, leave party alive
- Becomes rescue mission

**Guardian Fight**:
- Guardian takes Codices, inserts them, releases party
- "Find the third Codex. You have 2 years."

### If Session Must End Early
**Best Stop Points**:
1. After Council Meeting (4:30 PM)
2. After Assassination (6:00 PM)
3. At Seal entrance (7:15 PM)
4. After Seal puzzle (8:00 PM)

### If Players Going Totally Off-Script
**Stay Calm**:
- Ask "What's your goal here?"
- Redirect gently toward main plot
- Use NPCs to guide: "The seal is failing NOW"
- Roll with it if time allows
