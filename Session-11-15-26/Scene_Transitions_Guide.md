## Transition Philosophy

**Good Transitions**:
- Signal the end of current scene
- Build anticipation for next scene
- Maintain narrative flow
- Give players time to adjust

**Avoid**:
- Abrupt cuts without warning
- Long pauses without direction
- Confusion about time/location changes
- Losing dramatic momentum

## Time Management Between Scenes

### If Running AHEAD of Schedule

**Pad Scenes With**:
- Additional NPC interactions
- More detailed descriptions
- Extra exploration opportunities
- Longer combat (more enemies)
- Deeper roleplay moments

**Example**:
> "You have some extra time. Does anyone want to visit any NPCs, explore the city, or handle any personal business?"

---

### If Running BEHIND Schedule

**Speed Up By**:
- Montage transitions ("several hours pass...")
- Streamline NPC dialogues (hit key points only)
- Cut optional encounters (peaceful journey, no elementals)
- Faster combat (less tactical, more narrative)
- Skip flavor in favor of plot

**Example**:
> "To keep us moving, let's fast-forward through the travel. You arrive at the seal by afternoon. Now, what do you do?"

---

## Emergency Transition Phrases

### When Players Are Stuck
> "While you're deciding, let me describe what's around you..." (give them more info)

### When Players Go Off-Script
> "That's a great idea! We can explore that [next session/after this scene]. For now, let's handle [main plot]."

### When You Need to Railroad (Gently)
> "You could do that, but [NPC] urgently reminds you: [time-sensitive reason]. What do you think?"

### When Conversation Drags
> "As you're talking, [EVENT HAPPENS—interrupt with action]."

### When Combat Lasts Too Long
> "[Enemy] is clearly losing. They attempt to flee/surrender/call for mercy. What do you do?"

### When Scene Needs to End
> "This has been great! Let's put a pin in this and move to [next scene]. We'll come back to this if needed."

---

## Physical Transition Cues

### Use These to Signal Scene Changes:

**Stand Up**: Physical movement signals shift
**Change Music**: Different playlist/mood
**Shift Position**: Move to different spot at table
**Visual Aids**: Deploy new map, show handout
**Voice Change**: Alter tone/volume/pacing
**Pause**: 3-second silence before new scene

**Example**:
> [Stand up, change music, pause]
> "Alright everyone, new scene. It's now midnight. You're sleeping when—"

## Transition Checklist

Before transitioning, ask yourself:

- [ ] Did I resolve the current scene's objective?
- [ ] Do players understand what just happened?
- [ ] Is the next scene ready (map, stats, notes)?
- [ ] Do I need a break before next scene?
- [ ] What time is it in-game? Real-time?
- [ ] What's the mood shift? (music/tone)
- [ ] Do players need a moment to prepare?

---

## Example: Perfect Transition (Scene 8 → 9)

**Setup** (30 seconds before):
> "You're approaching the moment of truth. Whatever you decide about the Codices will shape everything. Take a moment to discuss."

**During Deliberation**:
[Let them talk, track time, 5 minutes max]

**The Transition**:
> [Players insert Codices]
> [Pause, let them watch]
> "The Codices lock into place. Light flares. The crack stops growing."
> [Pause]
> "Then, from the shadows—"
> [Change music to epic boss battle]
> "—grinding stone. Red light. A voice like mountains breaking."
> [Stand up, deploy combat map]
> "The Guardian awakens. And it's looking at you."
> [Dramatic pause]
> "ROLL INITIATIVE!"

## Troubleshooting Transitions

### Problem: Players Don't Want to Move On
**Solution**: "We can come back to this later. For now, [urgent reason to continue]."

### Problem: You Forgot Something
**Solution**: "Actually, before we transition—I forgot to mention [thing]. Okay, NOW we continue."

### Problem: Players Confused About Time/Location
**Solution**: "Let me clarify: It's [time], you're at [location], and [situation]. Good? Let's continue."

### Problem: Energy Is Low
**Solution**: "Let's take a 2-minute stretch break, then we'll dive into [exciting next scene]!"

## Final Tips

1. **Signal transitions clearly** - Don't let players wonder what's happening
2. **Match energy to scene** - Your tone sets the mood
3. **Use breaks strategically** - Between major acts, before combat
4. **Trust your prep** - You have scene files, use them!
5. **Be flexible** - If a transition isn't working, adjust
6. **Keep momentum** - Don't let scenes die with weak transitions

**Remember**: Transitions are like chapter breaks in a book. Make them count!
