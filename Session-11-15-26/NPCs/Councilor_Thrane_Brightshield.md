- **Promotion**: Earned command through merit and sacrifice
- **Flameguard**: Joined 20 years ago, commander for 10

### The Convergence Crisis
**His Perspective**:

- **Lesson Learned**: Magical artifacts must be controlled

**Impact**:
- Deeply grateful to the party (genuine)

- **Invested**: Has lived in Embercross for 30 years
- **Legacy**: Wants to leave city safer than he found it

## Council Meeting Position

### His Proposal
**"Lock the Codices in the Flameguard Vault"**

**Arguments**:
1. **Security**: "Our vault has never been breached in 50 years"
2. **Accountability**: "The Flameguard answers to the Council and the people"
3. **Access**: "Scholars can study them under supervision"
4. **Protection**: "We'll guard them with our lives - and actually have the force to do it"
5. **Proven**: "We protected the city during the Convergence. Trust us now."

**Rebuttals to Others**:
- **vs. Mirabel**: "The Ember Archive operates in shadows. We operate in the light."
- **vs. Church**: "Destruction is permanent. Containment allows future understanding."
- **vs. Party Keeping Them**: "You're heroes, not an army. How long before someone takes them from you?"

### What He'll Offer the Party
- **Immediate**: 5,000 gold payment for the Codices
- **Security**: Flameguard protection for the party
- **Access**: Visiting rights to study the Codices (supervised)
- **Honor**: Public ceremony recognizing their heroism
- **Practical**: "You can go back to adventuring without targets on your backs"

### His Weaknesses in Negotiation
- **Doesn't Understand Magic Fully**: Thinks vault = safety
- **Overconfident**: Believes Flameguard can handle any threat
- **Rigid**: Struggles with unconventional solutions
- **Pride**: Flameguard's reputation is on the line

## Relationship Dynamics

### With Mirabel
**Professional Respect, Philosophical Disagreement**

**History**:
- Worked together during smaller magical incidents
- Respects her knowledge but distrusts her secrecy
- Ember Archive's hidden nature bothers him

**Current**:
- "Mirabel's heart is in the right place, but shadows breed problems"
- Will listen to her arguments but remains skeptical
- Worried she'll take the Codices and disappear

**Interaction**:
- Thrane: "Your Archive hides while my Guard protects. Tell me which serves the people better?"
- Mirabel: "Protection without understanding is a dam waiting to break, Councilor."

### With High Priest Darius
**Allies by Default, Uneasy Partnership**

**Agreement**: Both want Codices out of civilian hands
**Disagreement**: Vault vs. Destruction

**Dynamic**:
- Thrane tolerates religious zealotry for political unity
- Sees Darius as useful but exhausting
- Will ally with him against Mirabel if needed

**Interaction**:
- "Priest, we can compromise: vault first, your rituals if vault fails"
- May team up for "secure then decide" approach

### With The Party
**Grateful but Concerned**

**Gratitude**: They saved Embercross when Flameguard couldn't
**Concern**: They're individuals with god-tier artifacts
**Respect**: Acknowledges their capability and heroism
**Fear**: They're not accountable to anyone

**Approach**:
- Treats them as honored guests, not criminals
- Appeals to their heroism and responsibility
- Offers fair compensation, not demands
- "You saved us once. Help us stay safe."

**If Party Refuses**:
- Disappointed but won't force the issue (yet)
- "I hope you know what you're doing"
- Will assign guards to "protect" them (also monitor)

**If Party Agrees**:
- Genuine gratitude and respect
- Honors all promises made
- Becomes long-term ally and resource

### With Captain Varn
**Unaware of True Threat**

**Current Knowledge**:
- Knows Varn as wealthy merchant and philanthropist
- Accepted Varn's donations to Flameguard
- Has no idea about Flamebrand Cult connection

**If Party Reveals Truth**:
- Initial skepticism: "Varn? The trade council member?"
- Demands evidence: "These are serious accusations"
- If convinced: Immediately mobilizes investigation
- "If this is true, he's played me for a fool. That ends now."

## DM Notes

### Making Thrane Sympathetic
**Avoid**: Making him generic lawful stupid paladin
**Instead**: Show his genuine care for the city
- Has him reference specific citizens by name
- Show exhaustion from years of responsibility
- Let him admit fears and uncertainties privately
- Demonstrate he learns from mistakes

- Offers safe haven and legitimacy
- Can mobilize against Varn's forces

**As Obstacle**:

### Thrane vs. Mirabel Debate
**Both Have Valid Points**:
- Thrane: Accountability, transparency, proven security
- Mirabel: Specialized knowledge, historical precedent, flexibility

**Party's Choice Matters**:
- Neither is "correct" answer
- Each has strengths and weaknesses
- Consequences flow naturally from choice
- Party can even propose third option

- Explain seal mechanics clearly
- Demonstrate Codex behavior
- Reveal Varn's cult connection

**If Convinced**:
