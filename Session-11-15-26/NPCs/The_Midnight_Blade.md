## DM Notes

### Making the Assassination Memorable

**Build Tension**:
- Have party notice they're being watched earlier
- Inn staff acting nervous (bribed)
- Vague warnings from The Bard or Professor

**During the Fight**:
- Use lighting (darkness favors Blade)
- Vertical combat (rooftops, windows)
- Civilians in danger (inn guests fleeing)
- Environmental hazards (fire spreading)

**After the Fight**:
- Investigation reveals Varn connection
- Survivors flee (creates ongoing threat)
- Inn damage (party's fault? Political complications)

### Midnight Blade as Character, Not Monster

**Humanize Them**:
- Not evil, just professional
- Has code of honor
- Respects worthy opponents
- Can be reasoned with

**Moral Complexity**:
- Killing them is justified but not heroic
- Capturing them provides intelligence
- Releasing them shows mercy (and gains respect)
- Recruiting them is expensive but useful

### Using the Encounter Politically

**Evidence Against Varn**:
- Blade's contract and paper
- Zealots' cult markings
- Payment trail
- If captured: Testimony

**Public Reaction**:
- "Assassins attacked our heroes!"
- Strengthens party's credibility
- Makes council more sympathetic
- Varn's alibi looks suspicious

### Aftermath Options

**Thrane**: "This proves you need protection. Accept my offer."
**Mirabel**: "Varn grows desperate. We must act quickly."
**Darius**: "The darkness strikes! Destroy the Codices now!"
**Varn** (if confronted): "Assassins? How terrible. I was at the trade conference. Ask anyone."
