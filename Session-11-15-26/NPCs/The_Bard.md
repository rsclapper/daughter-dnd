4. **Hidden**: Wants to chronicle this journey as epic ballad/book

### Character Development

## Knowledge & Information

### What The Bard Knows
**About the Codices**:
- They are nine keys to nine seals imprisoning the Ancient Fire Entity
- Keeping them together weakens all seals simultaneously
- Party's two Codices came from two different seal sites
- The Fractured Seal (15 miles NE) is missing its Codex - critically weakened

**About the Fractured Seal**:
- Primary seal location, requires THREE Codices to maintain (not one)
- Currently has zero Codices (all three scattered over time)
- Contains underground chamber with ancient binding magic
- Seal Guardian construct protects it (dormant until approached)

**About the Great Binding** (100 years ago):
- Twelve archmages sacrificed themselves to create the Nine Seals
- The Entity was too powerful to kill, only imprison
- Seals were meant to be permanent but require Codices as keys
- If all nine Codices are brought together, seals shatter completely

**About Current Factions**:
- **Flamebrand Cult**: Worships the Entity, wants to free it (knows about Varn)
- **Ember Archive**: Founded by survivors of Great Binding to guard seals
- **Mirabel**: Leader of Archive, spent 100+ years protecting this secret
- **Various Groups**: Treasure hunters, nobles, scholars - all want Codices for wrong reasons

**About the Party's Situation**:
- Multiple factions will hunt them for the Codices
- Keeping them is dangerous, but so is giving them to wrong people
- Best option: Return Codices to their respective seals
- Fractured Seal is priority - most critical and nearest

### What The Bard Will Share

**Initial Meeting** (Excited Info-Dump):
- "You have no idea what you're carrying! Those aren't artifacts, they're KEYS!"
- Shows research notes, ancient texts, historical diagrams
- Explains the Nine Seals and Ancient Fire Entity in detail
- Reveals location of Fractured Seal and its critical condition
- "We need to go there NOW, before someone tries to steal those from you!"

- References specific events from Great Binding (DC 15 History checks confirm)
- Introduces them to Mirabel as corroborating source
- "Look, I get it. But your Codices are GLOWING and whispering, right? That's the Entity testing its chains!"

**If Party Trusts Them**:
- Shares detailed maps to Fractured Seal
- Provides historical context for puzzles they'll encounter
- Warns about Seal Guardian and how to approach it
- Offers to accompany them (eager but knows they're not combat-focused)

**Strategic Information**:
- "Don't let the Codices stay together too long - weakens all seals"
- "The Fractured Seal needs all three of its Codices returned"
- "Varn - that noble whose vault you hit - he's Flamebrand Cult leader"
- "There's going to be a Council meeting. Three factions will try to claim the Codices"
