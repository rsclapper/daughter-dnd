## Background & History

### Early Life & Calling
- **Youth**: Survived village destroyed by dark magic (age 12)
- **Trauma**: Watched cultists sacrifice his family
- **Conversion**: Rescued by Church, dedicated life to preventing recurrence
- **Training**: 50 years serving the Eternal Light
- **Promotion**: Became High Priest of Embercross 15 years ago

### The Convergence Crisis
**His Perspective**:
- Saw it as punishment for tolerating magical artifacts
- Prayed for divine intervention (party arrived - he sees them as answer)
- Believes Codices should have been destroyed immediately after victory
- **Lesson Learned**: Mercy to evil artifacts invites catastrophe

**His Conclusion**:
- The party saved the city but made a mistake keeping the Codices
- Their "heroism" is incomplete until they destroy the artifacts
- Every day the Codices exist, another crisis brews

### Holy Mission
**Past Actions**:
- Burned dozens of "corrupted" magical items
- Exorcised possessed individuals (some died in process)
- Led crusade against a necromancer cult (successful)
- Controversial: Destroyed historical artifacts with "dark taint"

**Current Mission**:
- Convincing/compelling party to destroy Codices
- Preparing consecration ritual to unmake the artifacts
- Building public support for destruction
- Willing to use political pressure and religious authority

## Council Meeting Position

### His Proposal
**"Destroy the Codices Through Holy Consecration"**

**Arguments**:
1. **Theological**: "These artifacts are tools of the Calamity, thus inherently evil"
2. **Historical**: "Every time we 'study' dark magic, we fall to its corruption"
3. **Practical**: "You cannot steal what no longer exists"
4. **Moral**: "To possess evil is to be complicit in it"
5. **Desperate**: "The Eternal Light itself demands their destruction"

**Rebuttals to Others**:
- **vs. Thrane**: "Your vault didn't exist during the Calamity. These artifacts did."
- **vs. Mirabel**: "The seals failed once. They'll fail again. Permanent solution only."
- **vs. Party Keeping Them**: "You are good people carrying darkness. It will consume you."

### What He'll Offer the Party
- **Spiritual**: "The Eternal Light's blessing and forgiveness"
- **Religious**: Honored place in church history, canonization after death
- **Practical**: 3,000 gold from church coffers (less than others but all they have)
- **Moral**: "The peace of knowing you did the right thing"
- **Cosmic**: "Safety from the Codices' corruption of your souls"

### His Weaknesses in Negotiation
- **Fundamentalism**: Cannot comprehend middle ground
- **Dismissive**: Treats opposing views as ignorance or corruption
- **Aggressive**: Pushes too hard, alienates potential allies
- **Emotional**: Logic fails when passion takes over
- **Limited Resources**: Church is poorest faction at table

## Relationship Dynamics

### With Mirabel
**Theological Enemies, Reluctant Respect**

**Fundamental Disagreement**:
- Darius: "Destroy the tools of darkness"
- Mirabel: "Maintain the prison built by the ancients"

**Tension**:
- He sees her as misguided academic enabling evil
- She sees him as dangerous fundamentalist
- Both think they're saving the world
- Neither will compromise

**Interaction**:
- Darius: "You would preserve the chains that bind evil? I would shatter both chains and prisoner!"
- Mirabel: "And in your 'purification,' you would doom us all. The Entity laughs at your ignorance."

### With Thrane Brightshield
**Temporary Alliance, Different Goals**

**Common Ground**: Codices shouldn't be in civilian hands
**Difference**: Vault vs. Destruction

**Dynamic**:
- Will ally with Thrane against Mirabel
- "Lock them in your vault, Councilor, but promise me eventual destruction"
- Sees Thrane as lesser evil than Mirabel
- Respects Thrane's service but questions his faith

**Potential Betrayal**:
- If Codices go to vault, Darius might try to sneak in and destroy them
- "Forgive me, Councilor, but the Light demanded it"

### With The Party
**Conflicted - Saviors or Corrupted?**

**Gratitude**: They saved Embercross (divine instruments)
**Horror**: They kept the Codices (falling to darkness)
**Hope**: They might still do the right thing
**Fear**: They're already corrupted and don't know it

**Approach**:
- Appeals to their heroism and morality
- Warns of spiritual corruption
- Offers salvation through destruction
- "You were the Light's weapon against evil. Don't become evil's weapon now."

**If Party Refuses**:
- Deeply saddened, almost mourns them
- "The darkness has already claimed you. May the Light have mercy."
- Prays for their souls publicly
- May send followers to "save" them (steal Codices)

**If Party Agrees**:
- Joyous, declares it a miracle
- Immediately performs destruction ritual
- Canonizes them as saints
- Becomes fanatical ally

### With Captain Varn
**Completely Unaware**

**Current View**: Varn is respected philanthropist and church donor
**Reality**: Varn sees Darius as useful idiot

**If Darius Learns Truth**:
- Apocalyptic rage
- Declares holy crusade against Varn
- Sees it as ultimate betrayal
- "I took coin from the ENEMY?! The church is DEFILED!"

## The Destruction Ritual (If Party Agrees)

### Ceremony Details
**Location**: Church of Eternal Light main sanctuary
**Duration**: 3 hours
**Participants**: Darius, 12 acolytes, congregation, party (as witnesses)

**The Ritual**:
1. **Purification**: Party undergoes cleansing ceremony first
2. **Consecration**: Sanctuary blessed with holy water and prayers
3. **Separation**: Each Codex placed on separate altar
4. **Invocation**: Darius calls upon Eternal Light for cleansing fire
5. **Destruction**: Divine flame (not normal fire) consumes the Codices
6. **Final Prayer**: Thanks to the Light, blessing on the party

**What Actually Happens**:
- Codices begin to burn in holy flame
- Entity's voice SCREAMS from within them
- Walls shake, flames surge
- **CRITICAL MOMENT**: Codices resist destruction

**Revelation**:
- **Codices cannot be destroyed** - they're part of the seals themselves
- Attempting to destroy them weakens/breaks the seals
- Entity begins to manifest through the cracks
- Ritual must be stopped immediately

**Darius's Reaction**:
- Horror and confusion
- "Impossible! The Light cannot fail!"
- Mirabel arrives (if she's still around): "I TOLD you, you fool!"
- Darius must accept he was wrong (character growth) OR
- Doubles down: "We must burn HOTTER!" (if you want him to be antagonist)

**DM NOTE**: This is optional dramatic moment if party chooses destruction

**Avoid**: Generic religious fanatic villain
**Instead**: Show his trauma and genuine belief
- Flashbacks to family death (sparingly)
- Moments of doubt he quickly suppresses
- Genuine care for civilians
- Honestly believes he's saving people

### Darius's Character Arc Options

**Option 1: Redemption Through Failure**
- Ritual fails, he's forced to accept he was wrong
- Humbled, questions absolute beliefs
- Becomes wiser ally who learned nuance
- "The Light showed me my pride. Forgive me."

**Option 2: Tragic Antagonist**
- Refuses to accept he's wrong
- Becomes increasingly extreme
- Forces confrontation
- Dies believing he was right

**Option 3: Martyrdom**
- Sacrifices himself protecting innocents
- Final words acknowledge party was right
- Heroic death redeems his zealotry
- "Tell them... not all light casts shadows wisely..."

### Using Darius Effectively
**As Moral Voice**:
- Forces party to examine their choices
- Represents fear of power corruption
- Not wrong about danger, just wrong about solution

**As Obstacle**:
- Creates political problems
- Sends well-meaning but dangerous followers
- Public opinion weapon

**As Ally** (If Redeemed):
- Powerful cleric support
- Masses of faithful followers
- Healing and sanctuary
- Redemption arc satisfying for players

### The Destruction Ritual Drama
**If You Use This Scene**:
- Build tension slowly

- Mirabel's "I told you so" moment
- Teaches party and Darius important lesson
- Creates memorable moment

**Alternative**: Skip if party doesn't choose destruction

## Props & Handouts

### Religious Tract (Handed to Party)
*Simple pamphlet distributed by the Church*

---
**THE LIGHT'S WARNING**

*Citizens of Embercross, we were saved by heroes... but the evil remains.*

The Codices that nearly destroyed us still exist, carried by well-meaning but misguided souls. Every day they persist, the darkness grows stronger.

**The Church of Eternal Light calls upon the Heroes:**
Finish your good work. Destroy the artifacts of the Calamity. Purge the darkness so light may reign eternal.

**Free yourselves from this burden. The Light awaits.**

*Service times: Dawn, Midday, Dusk*
*High Priest Darius Lightbringer presiding*

### Letter from Darius (If Party Refuses at Council)
*Handwritten, slightly shaky script*

---
*Brave Heroes,*

*I spoke harshly at the Council. Passion overtook wisdom. Forgive an old priest his fears.*

*But please, hear me one final time:*

*I was twelve when dark magic consumed my village. I watched my mother burn. I held my father as corruption ate him from within. I survived only because kind priests arrived too late.*

*I have spent fifty years ensuring others do not suffer as I did.*

*When I look at those Codices, I see my family's killers. When I imagine them remaining in this world, I see my village burning again.*

*I do not ask you to trust me. I ask you to trust fifty years of hard-won wisdom: Evil artifacts corrupt even the purest hearts.*

*Destroy them before they destroy you.*

*In desperate hope,*
*High Priest Darius Lightbringer*

*P.S. - If you will not destroy them, at least allow me to perform a blessing. Protection from corruption is better than nothing.*

---

### Church Blessing (If Party Accepts Blessing)
*Darius performs 10-minute ritual*

**Effect**: Each party member gains:
- **Blessing of the Eternal Light** (7 days)
- Advantage on saves vs. possession/charm from fire entities
- Disadvantage on Codex corruption checks (if you're using them)
- Glowing sun symbol appears on forehead when near Entity's influence

---

## Darius's Ultimate Role

**Best Case**: Learns humility, becomes wise ally
**Good Case**: Respectfully disagrees, provides healing when needed
**Neutral Case**: Opposes politically but doesn't actively sabotage
**Bad Case**: Becomes zealot antagonist (still believes he's right)

**Potential Sacrifice**: Martyrdom protecting innocents from Entity/cult = powerful redemption

---

*"I have burned away darkness for fifty years. If I must burn myself to finish the work, I shall do so gladly. The Light demands nothing less."*
- High Priest Darius Lightbringer
