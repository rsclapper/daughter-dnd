## Tactical Considerations

### For The Midnight Blade's Team

**Entry Points**:
1. **Midnight Blade**: Second floor window (stealth)
2. **Wraith**: Second floor window (opposite side)
3. **Raven**: Rooftop across street (overwatch)
4. **Crusher**: Back alley (blocks escape)

**Assassination Plan**:
- Blade and Wraith enter party rooms simultaneously
- Surprise round if undetected
- Raven provides covering fire
- Crusher prevents escape
- Zealots create chaos if alarm raised

**Escape Routes**:
- Windows to street
- Rooftop to rooftop (Blade's preferred)
- Back alley (if Crusher defeated)
- Front door (risky, city watch)

### For The Party

**Defensive Positions**:
- Barricade doors with furniture
- Cover behind bar/tables
- High ground on stairs
- Protect Codex bearers

**Offensive Tactics**:
- Send flyer/teleporter after Raven
- Block stairs to prevent retreat
- Use environment (fire, falling objects)
- Flush out assassins from cover

**Escape Options** (If Losing):
- Break through kitchen to alley
- Climb to roof and flee
- Hole up in defensible room
- Call for help (city watch 5 rounds away)
