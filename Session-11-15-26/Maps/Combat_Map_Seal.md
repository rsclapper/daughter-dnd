## Environmental Hazards (Lair Actions)

### Crystal Growth (Lair Action)
**Effect**: 20 ft radius becomes difficult terrain + 3d6 piercing damage
**Location**: DM chooses point in room
**Visual**: Crystals erupt from floor like spikes
**Duration**: Permanent until destroyed

**Map Reference**: Mark with tokens/dice where crystals grow

### Seal Illumination (Lair Action)
**Effect**: Bright flash, DC 16 CON save or blinded
**Location**: Entire room
**Visual**: Seal flares like sun
**Duration**: Blindness lasts until end of next turn
**Tactical**: Guardian uses to disable ranged attackers

**Map Reference**: Affects whole room, no specific location

### Archmage Whispers (Lair Action)
**Effect**: One PC charmed, moves toward seal
**Location**: Seal (target must approach it)
**Visual**: Ghostly figures appear, beckoning
**Duration**: Until Initiative 20 next round
**Tactical**: Guardian separates party

**Map Reference**: Draw line from target to seal

## Initiative & Starting Positions

### Guardian's Position
**Round 0** (Emergence): In alcove, activating
**Round 1+**: Center of room, near seal

### Party Starting Positions
**Entry**: Coming through southern entrance archway

**Suggested Formation**:
- Tank/Melee: 15-20 ft from entrance (moving toward seal)
- Ranged/Casters: 10-15 ft from entrance (using pillars as cover)
- Healer/Support: Near entrance (safety/escape route access)

### Round 1 Typical Layout:
```
        North
       [GUARDIAN]
         (Alcove)

    P1 ◆        ◆ P2
       \Guardian/
        \(Seal)/
    P3 ◆        ◆ P4
         [Party]
        (Scattered)

## Special Combat Scenarios

### If Guardian Blocks Entrance
**Tactic**: Guardian uses position to prevent escape
**Effect**: Must defeat or convince Guardian to leave
**Counter**: Party can try to slip past (DC 18 Acrobatics)

### If Party Surrounds Guardian
**Advantage**: Flanking, multiple angles of attack
**Guardian Response**: Uses Seal Resonance (legendary) to knock prone
**Risk**: Guardian has 10 ft reach, can hit multiple targets

### If Fight Moves to Walls
**Party Advantage**: Crystal veins vulnerable here
**Guardian Response**: Protects veins, uses Phase Shift to intercept

### If Party Uses Vertical Space
**Flying/Levitating**: Guardian has ranged Crystal Lance
**Climbing Walls**: Guardian uses Arcane Binding to pull down
**Standing on Seal**: Guardian prioritizes removing them (sacred ground)
