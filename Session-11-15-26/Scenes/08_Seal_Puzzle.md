**Complete Exploration**: See `Encounters/Fractured_Seal.md`
**Combat Map**: See `Maps/Combat_Map_Seal.md`

## Chamber 1: Entrance Hall

**Read** (upon entering):
> *The corridor opens into a vast hall, 60 feet across and 40 feet high. The floor is polished black stone, inlaid with silver lines forming a massive circle—a seal diagram. At the center, in ancient script:*
>
> **"WHERE THREE BECAME NINE, THE BINDING HOLDS"**
>
> *Three doorways lead deeper:*
> *LEFT: Heavy bronze doors, sealed*
> *CENTER: The Fractured Seal—you see the crack from here, glowing with red light*
> *RIGHT: Open archway, lit with soft blue light*

**Arcana Check** (examining floor diagram):
- **DC 10**: This is a map of the Nine Seals network
- **DC 15**: The diagram shows energy flow—this is the PRIMARY seal, the anchor for all nine
- **DC 20**: The other eight seals feed power here; if this one fails, all nine collapse

**Perception Check**:
- **DC 12**: Dust shows no recent footprints (Varn hasn't been here recently)
- **DC 16**: The bronze doors (left) are warded with magic (trap)
- **DC 18**: The crack in the center seal is growing—visibly, slowly, like ice breaking

---

## Chamber 2: Hall of Archmages (Optional)

**Accessed through RIGHT archway**

**Read**:
> *This chamber is a memorial. Twelve alcoves line the walls, each holding a statue: the archmages who performed the Great Binding.*
>
> *Their names are carved in Common and in three dead languages:*
>
> *Thalorien the Wise, Seraphina Emberheart, Davik Stormcaller, Mirela Starweaver...*
>
> *Twelve names. Twelve statues. And at the center, a plaque:*
>
> **"FIVE GAVE THEIR LIVES. SEVEN GAVE THEIR FUTURES. WE GAVE EVERYTHING SO THE WORLD MIGHT ENDURE."**

**History Check**:
- **DC 12**: These are legendary figures, founders of magical orders
- **DC 16**: Most died or were crippled by the binding ritual
- **DC 20**: Mirabel's lineage traces to Mirela Starweaver (5th statue)

**Investigation Check** (examining statues):
- **DC 14**: Each holds a symbol representing their contribution (fire, water, earth, air, life, death, etc.)
- **DC 17**: Fresh flowers at Mirela's statue (Mirabel has been here recently)

**The Bard** (if present):
> *"These people saved the world. And the world forgot them. That's why I chronicle stories—so heroes aren't forgotten."*

**Lore Plaque** (if examined):
> *Text in Common:*
>
> *"In the Age of Flame, the Entity consumed nations. We twelve bound it in nine prisons, each sealed with a key. Guard them. Protect them. For if all nine keys gather, the binding breaks, and the Flame rises again."*

**DM Note**: This provides critical context—collecting all nine Codices is EXACTLY what Varn is doing.

---

## Chamber 3: The Seal Chamber (Main Location)

**Accessed through CENTER archway**

**Read** (dramatic reveal):
> *You enter the heart of the ruins—a circular chamber, 60 feet across. The ceiling is a dome covered in constellations that move, showing the sky as it was 1,200 years ago.*
>
> *At the chamber's center: the Seal.*
>
> *It's a pillar of obsidian, 15 feet tall, covered in glowing glyphs. Three keyholes are set into its face, arranged in a triangle. Each keyhole burns with faint internal light.*
>
> *The crack you saw from outside runs through the pillar—a jagged fracture leaking red mist. The whispers are loudest here. Insistent. Hungry.*
>
> *Around the chamber: eight crystal veins in the walls, pulsing with energy. Four stone pillars carved with protective runes. And in the shadows—*
>
> *Something moves.*

**Hold description of Guardian for now—let them explore first.**

## Examining the Seal (The Puzzle)

**Arcana Check** (examining seal):
- **DC 10**: Three keyholes require three keys (Codices) to fully seal
- **DC 15**: Currently empty—this is why the seal is failing
- **DC 18**: Inserting Codices will strengthen seal, buying time

**Investigation Check** (examining keyholes):
- **DC 12**: Each keyhole is labeled: "First," "Second," "Third"
- **DC 16**: Fresh scratches around "Third" keyhole (something removed recently)
- **DC 19**: Graffiti, small, in Common: "S.V. 1975" (Solric Varn's grandfather, 50 years ago)

**The Third Codex Revelation**:

**Read** (if they succeed DC 16 Investigation):
> *Someone removed the third Codex. Recently—maybe 50 years ago. And they left their mark.*
>
> *Scratched in the stone: "S.V. 1975"*

**If party connects dots**:
- Varn's family stole the third Codex 50 years ago
- Varn currently possesses it (mentioned in interrogation)
- Party has two Codices, Varn has one
- To fully seal: Need all three
- Current options: Insert both, one, or neither

---

## The Decision: What to Do with the Codices

**Present the Choice**:

### Option 1: Insert Both Codices
**Effect**:
- Strengthens seal significantly
- Buys 2-4 years before seal fails
- Party loses both Codices permanently
- Guardian will be respectful (moderate difficulty fight)

**Pros**: Right thing to do, buys most time
**Cons**: Lose Codices, Varn still has third

---

### Option 2: Insert One Codex
**Effect**:
- Strengthens seal partially
- Buys weeks to months before seal fails
- Party keeps one Codex (still hunted)
- Guardian will be concerned (hard difficulty fight)

**Pros**: Middle ground, maintain one Codex
**Cons**: Less time, still endangered, seal still failing

---

### Option 3: Insert Neither
**Effect**:
- Seal continues failing
- Days to weeks before catastrophic failure
- Party keeps both Codices (maximum hunted)
- Guardian will be hostile (deadly difficulty fight + adds)

**Pros**: Party maintains control/power
**Cons**: Selfish choice, Guardian very angry, world at risk

---

### Option 4: Wait for Third Codex
**Effect**:
- Delay decision until Varn confronted
- Seal continues failing during delay
- Guardian will not allow party to leave with Codices
- Must make choice NOW

**DM Note**: This isn't really an option—Guardian forces resolution.

---

## Party Deliberation (10-15 minutes)

**Allow party to**:
- Discuss options openly
- Examine the seal more
- Ask questions of The Bard or NPCs
- Debate morality and tactics
- Make their choice

**The Bard's Opinion** (if asked):
> *"Insert both. We can deal with Varn later, retrieve the third, complete the seal. But if this seal breaks before then... there won't be a later."*

**Mirabel's Opinion** (via sending stone, if they have one):
> *"Both. Please. Buy us time. We'll find Varn, take the third Codex, finish this properly."*

---

## The Moment of Choice

**When party decides**:

**Read** (if inserting Codices):
> *You approach the seal, Codices in hand. They grow hot—almost too hot to hold. The glyphs on the pillar flare brighter.*
>
> *As you insert [one/both], there's a flash of red light. The Codices lock into place, glowing from within. The crack in the seal... doesn't close, but it stops growing. The whispers quiet—slightly.*
>
> *Then, from the shadows, a voice like grinding stone:*
>
> **"WHO DARES APPROACH THE SEAL?"**

**Read** (if not inserting):
> *You step toward the seal—but not to insert the Codices. You're keeping them.*
>
> *From the shadows, a voice like grinding stone:*
>
> **"YOU CARRY THE KEYS. YOU APPROACH THE PRISON. YET YOU DO NOT SEAL?"**
>
> *Red light floods the chamber. The whispers become a roar.*
>
> **"UNWORTHY."**

---

## The Guardian Awakens (Transition to Scene 9)

**Read** (dramatic reveal):
> *The shadows coalesce. Stone grinds against stone. From an alcove you hadn't noticed, it emerges:*
>
> *A massive construct, 12 feet tall, carved from volcanic stone and veined with crystal. Its eyes burn with ancient fire. Glyphs cover its body—the same glyphs as on the seal. It moves with impossible grace for something so massive.*
>
> *This is the Guardian. Left by the twelve archmages to protect the seal. To test those who approach.*
>
> *And it's looking at you.*

**Guardian's Opening Words** (varies by choice):

**If Inserted Both**:
> *"You honor the binding. You show wisdom. But wisdom alone is not enough. PROVE YOUR WORTH."*

**If Inserted One**:
> *"You hesitate. You hold back. This concerns me. SHOW ME YOU ARE NOT THIEVES."*

**If Inserted Neither**:
> *"THIEVES. DESPOILERS. YOU WOULD WEAKEN THE PRISON FURTHER? I WILL NOT ALLOW IT."*

**Roll Initiative!**
