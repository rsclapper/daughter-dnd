>
> *You're left with evidence, bodies, and questions.*

**Flameguard Captain** (if Thrane not yet arrived):
> *"We need statements from each of you. And we need to examine... everything."*

---

## Evidence Examination

### Physical Evidence Available:

1. **The Contract** (on Midnight Blade's body)
2. **Cult Symbols** (tattoos and medallions)
3. **Payment Pouch** (500 gp advance)
4. **Maps and Plans** (inn layout, escape routes)
5. **Weapons** (masterwork, expensive)
6. **Prisoner(s)** (if captured alive)

---

## Skill Check Investigation

### Examining the Contract

**Read** (if found):
> *A sealed parchment, folded and tucked in the Midnight Blade's inner pocket. The wax seal bears a symbol: a hammer crossed with a flame—the Varn family crest.*

**Contents**:
> *"To the Midnight Blade,*
>
> *Target: The two Flamebound Codices currently held by the party of adventurers at Wayfarer's Rest Inn, Embercross.*
>
> *Objective: Retrieve both Codices by any means. Elimination of bearers authorized if necessary.*
>
> *Payment: 500 gold advance (delivered). 9,500 gold upon delivery of both Codices.*
>
> *Delivery Location: [Encoded coordinates]*
>
> *Deadline: Three days from contract date.*
>
> *—S.V."*

**Investigation Check**:
- **DC 10**: Signature "S.V." matches Solric Varn's known handwriting style
- **DC 15**: Coordinates decode to warehouse district, eastern docks
- **DC 18**: Paper is expensive (Varn's known supplier)

---

### Examining Cult Symbols

**Read**:
> *The cultists bear tattoos on their left shoulders—a stylized flame with ancient script wrapped around it. The medallions match this symbol exactly.*

**Religion or Arcana Check**:
- **DC 12**: Symbol represents the Ancient Fire Entity (imprisoned being)
- **DC 15**: This is a cult devoted to freeing the Entity
- **DC 18**: Cult name: "Flamebrand Covenant" (extremist sect, outlawed 200 years ago)

**History Check**:
- **DC 14**: Flamebrand Covenant tried to free the Entity before, caused disaster
- **DC 17**: Varn family has historical ties to this cult (grandfather was suspected member)

---

### Examining the Maps

**Read**:
> *Hand-drawn maps of the inn—accurate down to which rooms you were staying in. Marked escape routes through alleys, rooftops.*

**Investigation Check**:
- **DC 10**: Someone inside the inn provided information (floor plans too accurate)
- **DC 15**: Recent ink (drawn within past 24 hours)
- **DC 18**: Handwriting matches Wraith's other notes

**Insight with Inn Staff**:
- **DC 13**: Maid admits someone paid her 10 gold to describe room layouts
- **DC 16**: She describes the person—matches Wraith's description

---

### Examining Weapons & Gear

**Appraise or Investigation**:
- **DC 10**: High quality, expensive (100+ gp per weapon)
- **DC 14**: Masterwork craftsmanship, professional equipment
- **DC 17**: Specific smithy mark—traced to capital city armorer (expensive commissions only)

**Conclusion**: These are professionals, well-funded.

---

## Interrogation (If Assassin Captured)

### Setup

**Location**: Flameguard holding cell or secured room at inn

**Prisoner Options**:
- **Midnight Blade** (best intel, hardest to break)
- **Wraith** (good intel, medium difficulty)
- **Zealot** (fanatic, hard to break but knows less)

---

### Interrogating the Midnight Blade

**Initial State**: Professional, calm, unafraid

**Read**:
> *The Midnight Blade sits bound to a chair, calm and composed despite their injuries. They meet your gaze evenly.*
>
> **Midnight Blade**: *"So. You won. Congratulations. What now?"*

**Intimidation Check**:
- **DC 18**: They flinch, admit Varn hired them
- **DC 22**: Provide warehouse location voluntarily
- **Failure**: *"I've endured worse. Do your worst."*

**Persuasion Check**:
- **DC 16**: Appeal to honor—"Varn betrayed you by giving you impossible odds"
- **DC 20**: Offer deal—"Testify against Varn, we'll speak for leniency"
- **Success**: Provides information below

**Insight Check** (reading them):
- **DC 14**: They're not fanatical—this was just a job
- **DC 17**: They respect competence—party's victory earned grudging respect
- **DC 20**: They're afraid of Varn (more than law, more than death)

---

### What Midnight Blade Knows (If They Talk):

1. **Varn hired them** (met in person, three days ago)
2. **Payment**: 10,000 gp total for both Codices
3. **Varn's Goal**: "He's collecting them. Needs all nine for some ritual."
4. **Cult Connection**: "Varn leads the Flamebrand Covenant. Not just a member—the leader."
5. **Warehouse Location**: Eastern docks, Warehouse 7 (cult meeting place)
6. **Varn's Plans**: "He's leaving the city soon. Taking his collection somewhere."
7. **Other Codices**: "He has at least one more. Keeps it with him always."

**Critical Info**:
> **Midnight Blade**: *"You think you've won? Varn has resources you can't imagine. Wealth, followers, connections. And he's obsessed. You'll see him again."*

---

### Interrogating a Zealot

**Initial State**: Fanatic, defiant, half-mad

**Read**:
> *The zealot's eyes burn with fervor. They strain against their bonds, grinning.*
>
> **Zealot**: *"The Flame rises! The binding weakens! You cannot stop what is coming!"*

**Intimidation** (DC 20): They laugh at threats
**Persuasion** (DC 22): Nearly impossible—true believer

**Better Approach**: Religion or Insight checks
- **Religion DC 15**: Engage theologically—"The Entity doesn't care about you"
- **Insight DC 16**: Find crack in fanaticism—fear of abandonment

**What Zealot Knows** (if broken):
1. **Varn is prophet of the Entity**: "He speaks with the Flame!"
2. **Ritual requires nine Codices**: "Nine keys, nine seals, nine offerings"
3. **Entity promises power**: "We will be reborn in flame!"
4. **Warehouse meetings**: "We gather in the shadows, await His call"
5. **Deadline**: "Soon. So soon. Days, not weeks."

**Fanatic's Warning**:
> **Zealot**: *"You delay the inevitable. The Flame is patient. It has waited twelve centuries. It can wait a few more days... for you to fail."*

## Councilor Thrane Arrives (If Allied)

**Read**:
> *The door opens. Councilor Thrane enters, still in her armor, flanked by two senior Flameguard officers. She looks furious.*
>
> **Thrane**: *"Assassins. In my city. Attacking heroes under my protection."*
>
> *She looks at the evidence, then at you.*
>
> **Thrane**: *"Tell me everything."*

**After hearing the story**:

**Thrane's Response**:
> *"Varn. I've suspected him for years, but he's careful—politically connected, wealthy, respected. This contract is evidence, but not enough for arrest. He'd claim it's forged."*
>
> *She pauses.*
>
> *"But if you found proof in his warehouse—cult activities, stolen artifacts, more Codices—that's actionable. I could move against him officially."*

**Her Offer**:
1. **Flameguard Support**: "I'll assign a squad to investigate the warehouse—with you, if you want"
2. **Legal Protection**: "I'll ensure you're not charged for any... necessary actions"
3. **Resources**: "Equipment, healing, information—whatever you need"
4. **Alternative**: "Or... you could handle this quietly. Sometimes the law is too slow."

**Insight Check** (DC 12):
- She's giving you permission to raid the warehouse
- She wants Varn taken down but needs plausible deniability
- She'll support you either way

## Party Discussion: Next Steps

**Present Options**:

1. **Raid Varn's Warehouse Tonight**
   - Evidence might be there
   - Cult members possibly present
   - Could find third Codex
   - Risk: Varn might be warned

2. **Travel to Fractured Seal First**
   - Strengthen the seal with Codices
   - Deal with Varn later
   - Risk: Varn might escape

3. **Rest and Investigate Tomorrow**
   - Party is wounded, low on resources
   - Gather more information first
   - Risk: Varn might flee city

4. **Split the Party**
   - Some go to Fractured Seal
   - Others raid warehouse
   - Risk: Divided strength

**DM Guidance**: Steer toward Fractured Seal (Scene 7-10), but allow warehouse raid if they insist.

## Transition to Dinner Break

**Read**:
> *The night wears on. It's past 1:00 AM in-game. The investigation has yielded answers—and more questions. The path forward is clearer, but no less dangerous.*
>
> *The Codices rest heavily in your packs, warmer than before.*

**Tell Players**:
"Great work everyone. Let's take a 30-minute dinner break. Eat, rest, stretch. When we return, we'll decide: do you head to the Fractured Seal, or raid the warehouse first? Think it over during break."

**DM Prep During Break**:
- Review Fractured Seal encounter (likely next)
- Prepare Seal Guardian stats
- Set up seal chamber map
- Eat, hydrate, rest your voice

## DM Notes

**Energy Level**: MODERATE - Mystery, tension
**Pace**: DELIBERATE - Let players examine evidence
**Music**: Investigation, noir mystery

**Encourage Player Agency**:
- Let them examine what interests them
- Reward good skill checks with information
- Don't force them toward Fractured Seal—but incentivize it
- Warehouse raid can be next session if they choose

**Time Management**:
- Evidence examination: 10 minutes
- Interrogation: 10 minutes
- Thrane scene: 5 minutes
- Party discussion: 5 minutes

**Common Questions**:
- Q: "Can we arrest Varn now?"
  - A: Thrane: "Not without more evidence. He'd lawyer up, claim forgery."

- Q: "Where is Varn right now?"
  - A: "Unknown. Not at his mansion. Possibly at warehouse or already fled."

- Q: "Can we destroy the cult?"
  - A: "Absolutely, but that's a longer campaign arc. For now, focus on the Codices."

**Time Check**: Should end by 6:30 PM (dinner break)
