## Setting the Scene

**Read** (as you return from break):
> *The afternoon and evening have passed. The city sleeps. It's now 11:30 PM—just before midnight.*
>
> *You're in your rooms at the Wayfarer's Rest Inn. The common room below is quiet. Outside, the streets are dark except for occasional street lamps.*
>
> *The Codices rest [wherever party stored them]. They're warm to the touch, and you can almost hear them whispering.*

**Ask Players**:
"Before we begin—did anyone set watch? Are you sleeping in armor? Where are your weapons?"

**Note their answers carefully!**

---

## Surprise Round Determination

### If Party Set Watch + Defenses (Alarm, Barricades)
- **No Surprise** - Party is alert
- Roll initiative normally
- Assassins' infiltration detected

### If Party Set Watch Only
- **Contested Roll**: Watcher's Passive Perception vs. Assassins' Stealth (+8)
- **Success**: No surprise, party alerted
- **Failure**: Surprise round for assassins

### If No Watch or Defenses
- **Surprise Round**: Assassins get free round
- Party members sleeping are **prone** and potentially **unarmored**
- Weapons must be drawn (action or object interaction)

---

## Infiltration (If Not Detected)

**Read**:
> *[If party sleeping] You dream of fire. Of ancient voices. Of something vast and hungry, far beneath the earth.*
>
> *Then—*
>
> *CRASH!*
>
> *Glass shatters. Your door slams open. Dark figures pour into your room, blades gleaming in the moonlight.*
>
> **Assassin**: *"The Codices. Now. Or die."*

**Roll Initiative!**

---

## If Party Detected Infiltration

**Read**:
> *[If watch set] You're on watch when you hear it—the faint scrape of metal on stone. The creak of a window. Movement on the roof.*
>
> *Then you see them: shadowed figures, climbing through second-floor windows. Professional. Silent. Armed.*
>
> *And they're heading for your rooms.*

**Roll Initiative!**

## DM Notes

**Energy Level**: EXTREME - Intense, fast-paced
**Pace**: RAPID - Keep combat moving
**Music**: Epic combat, high tension

**Combat Tips**:
- Track initiative on visible board
- Use timer for player turns (60 seconds) to maintain pace
- Describe environmental changes (fire spreading, smoke)
- Make assassins feel competent (they're professionals)
- Allow creative tactics (environment is full of options)

**Common Issues**:

**Combat Too Easy**:
- Increase HP by 25%
- Add reinforcements (2 more zealots)
- Raven focuses fire better

**Combat TPK Risk**:
- Flameguard arrives early (Round 4)
- Assassins achieve objective (steal Codex) and flee
- NPC ally helps (The Bard, Mirabel)
- Reduce damage slightly

**Time Management**:
- Combat should take 30-40 minutes
- Don't let rounds drag
- Keep describing action cinematically

**Time Check**: Should be done by 6:00 PM, right before dinner break

---

## Quick Reference

**Next Scene**: Investigation & Interrogation (6:00-6:30 PM)
**Next Location**: Inn (crime scene) or Flameguard holding cells
**Mood Shift**: Intense combat → Mystery investigation

**Important**: Track evidence collected, assassins captured, civilian casualties, and property damage. This affects next scene!
