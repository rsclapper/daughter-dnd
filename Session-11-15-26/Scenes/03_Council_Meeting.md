## Council Chamber Description

**Read**:
> *The Council Chamber is circular, with a high domed ceiling painted with historical murals. Three seats arranged in a triangle dominate the room, each behind a desk bearing a faction symbol.*
>
> *To your left: **A crimson banner with a flaming sword** (Flameguard)*
> *Straight ahead: **A silver flame within an open book** (Ember Archive)*
> *To your right: **A golden sun radiating light** (Church of Eternal Light)*
>
> *Three figures rise as you enter.*

---

## The Three Faction Leaders

### Councilor Thrane Brightshield (Flameguard)
**Read**:
> *A tall human woman in polished armor, her red cloak bearing the Flameguard crest. Mid-40s, battle-scarred, commanding presence. She nods respectfully.*
>
> **Thrane**: *"Heroes. Welcome. Please, sit."*

**Demeanor**: Professional, direct, respectful
**Voice**: Commanding but warm

---

### Mirabel (Ember Archive)
**Read**:
> *The half-elf woman you met during the Convergence Crisis. Ancient eyes that have seen too much. She looks relieved to see you, but also worried.*
>
> **Mirabel**: *"Thank the Archives you're safe. We have much to discuss."*

**Demeanor**: Scholarly, cautious, knows more than she's saying
**Voice**: Measured, thoughtful

---

### High Priest Darius Lightbringer (Church)
**Read**:
> *An elderly human priest in golden robes, his white beard braided with holy symbols. His eyes burn with zealous intensity.*
>
> **Darius**: *"Children of the Light. The gods smile upon your victory. But dark work remains."*

**Demeanor**: Zealous, absolute certainty, no compromise
**Voice**: Preacher-like, dramatic

---

## Opening Statements

**Thrane** (speaks first, as Council chair):
> *"Let's be direct. You possess two Flamebound Codices—ancient artifacts of immense power. The Convergence Crisis proved they're too dangerous to remain... unaccounted for. We three factions have proposals for their safekeeping. Please, hear us out."*

**She gestures to the others. The presentations begin.**

---

## Proposal 1: Flameguard Vault (Thrane)

**Thrane's Pitch** (5 minutes, read or paraphrase):

> *"The Flameguard has protected Embercross for three hundred years. We have vaults designed to hold dangerous artifacts—magical wards, armed guards, layers of security."*
>
> *She produces a contract.*
>
> *"We propose: Store the Codices in our vault. We guarantee their safety. In return, we offer you **5,000 gold pieces** as compensation, plus continued protection. Should you need to study them—under supervision—access can be arranged."*
>
> *"We understand these artifacts saved your lives. We won't take them by force. But we believe our vault is the safest place in the region."*

**Pros**:
- Safety and security
- 5,000 gp payment
- Flameguard protection for the party
- Access for study (limited)

**Cons**:
- Party loses direct control
- Vault is a static target (could be breached)
- Insider threats possible

**Thrane's Goal**: Pragmatic security. Not villainous, genuinely believes this is safest.

---

## Proposal 2: Return to the Seals (Mirabel)

**Mirabel's Pitch** (5 minutes, passionate):

> *"I must speak plainly. The Codices are not treasures. They are **keys**. Keys to nine seals that imprison an ancient entity of flame."*
>
> *She stands, addressing you directly.*
>
> *"Twelve centuries ago, nine archmages bound this entity in nine locations. Each seal was locked with a Codex. When you removed these from their seals, you weakened the binding. The Convergence Crisis was a symptom."*
>
> *"The Fractured Seal—15 miles northeast—is the PRIMARY seal. It needs **three** Codices to remain stable. You have two. The third was stolen 50 years ago."*
>
> *She looks desperate.*
>
> *"Please. Return the Codices to the Fractured Seal. Strengthen the binding. Buy us time to find the third. The alternative is... apocalyptic."*

**Pros**:
- Morally right (protects the world)
- Strengthens the seal (buys 2-4 years)
- Mirabel as ally and information source
- Party keeps their heroic reputation

**Cons**:
- Party loses the Codices entirely
- No payment
- Trusting ancient magic
- Doesn't solve long-term problem

**Mirabel's Goal**: Prevent apocalypse. She's genuinely terrified of the Entity.

**Key Information**: She reveals the Nine Seals system and the missing third Codex.

---

## Proposal 3: Destroy the Codices (Darius)

**Darius's Pitch** (5 minutes, dramatic):

> *"Hear the word of the Eternal Light! These artifacts reek of dark flame. They corrupt. They whisper. They draw evil to you like moths to a lantern!"*
>
> *He slams his hand on the desk.*
>
> *"The Church has purification rituals capable of destroying even the most cursed objects. We will **unmake** these Codices—erase them from existence. No vault can be breached if the prize doesn't exist!"*
>
> *He softens slightly.*
>
> *"We offer 3,000 gold pieces for this service. And I will personally bless each of you with divine protection. You will walk in the Light, free from the curse these objects bear."*

**Pros**:
- Permanent solution (allegedly)
- 3,000 gp payment
- Divine blessing (mechanical benefit)
- No more assassination attempts

**Cons**:
- **WILL FAIL** (Codices are indestructible keys)
- Mirabel will STRONGLY oppose this
- Destroying a Codex weakens its seal catastrophically
- May cause immediate disaster

**Darius's Goal**: Eliminate what he sees as evil. Zealot, but not malicious.

**DM SECRET**: If party chooses this, the ritual fails dramatically. The Codices cannot be destroyed—they're anchors to the seals. Attempting this weakens the Fractured Seal immediately. Mirabel will intervene, and the party must choose a new option.

---

## Party Deliberation (15 minutes)

**After all three pitches**:

**Thrane**: *"Take time to discuss. This decision shouldn't be rushed."*

**Allow party to**:
- Ask questions of each faction leader
- Request private discussion
- Investigate claims (Arcana, Insight checks)
- Consult with each other

---

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: "What happens if we keep them?"**
- **Thrane**: "That's your right. But you'll be hunted by every faction that wants them. Including those who'd use them for evil."
- **Mirabel**: "The longer they're away from the seal, the weaker it becomes. Weeks. Maybe months."
- **Darius**: "You'll be cursed. The whispers will grow louder."

**Q: "Who stole the third Codex?"**
- **Mirabel**: "The Varn family, 50 years ago. Captain Solric Varn likely has it now."

**Q: "Can the Codices really be destroyed?"**
- **Mirabel**: "NO! They're bound to the seals. Destroying one breaks its seal entirely!" (She'll passionately argue against Darius)
- **Darius**: "Heretical nonsense. The Light can unmake anything touched by darkness."
- **Thrane**: "I'm... uncertain. Perhaps we should consult more experts first."

**Q: "What's in this for each of you?"**
- **Thrane**: "Safety. Order. My job is protecting this city."
- **Mirabel**: "Preventing the apocalypse. That's literally all I care about."
- **Darius**: "Cleansing evil. Serving the Light."

**Q: "Can we split them—give one to each faction?"**
- **Mirabel**: "ABSOLUTELY NOT! Splitting them weakens BOTH seals they came from. That's worse than keeping them together!"

---

## Insight Checks (If Players Roll)

**Thrane** (DC 12):
- Genuinely wants safety, not power
- Bit of pride involved (Flameguard reputation)
- Slightly worried about political fallout

**Mirabel** (DC 10):
- Terrified of what happens if seals fail
- Holding back additional information (about the Entity)
- 100% sincere, no hidden agenda

**Darius** (DC 14):
- Trauma-driven zealotry (lost family to magical disaster)
- Genuinely believes he's right
- Would be horrified if ritual failed

---

## Professor Maellin Interruption (Optional - Add Drama)

**If scene needs energy boost**:

**Read**:
> *The chamber doors burst open. Professor Maellin stumbles in, looking terrible—gaunt, shaking, eyes sunken.*
>
> **Maellin**: *"Wait! Before you decide—"*
>
> *He coughs violently, steadying himself against a column.*
>
> **Maellin**: *"I've studied these artifacts. They're... they're linked to something vast. Something ancient. If you destroy them or lock them away, you lose the only chance to understand what's coming."*
>
> **Thrane**: *"Professor, this is a closed session—"*
>
> **Maellin**: *"I know what Varn is planning! I was funded by him! He wants all nine Codices. He's already killed for them!"*
>
> *He looks at you desperately.*
>
> **Maellin**: *"Please. Let me help you understand what you're dealing with before you decide."*

**This adds**:
- Link to Varn (villain presence)
- Maellin's desperation and sickness visible
- Urgency to decision
- Optional: Party can ask Maellin questions

**Thrane's Response**: Allows him to speak briefly, but maintains order.

---

## The Decision

**Ask Players**: "What do you want to do with the Codices?"

**Options**:
1. **Give to Flameguard Vault** (5,000 gp, security, lose direct control)
2. **Return to Fractured Seal** (heroic, buys time, lose Codices)
3. **Church Destruction** (FAILS, must choose again)
4. **Keep Them** (maintain control, all factions oppose, hunted)
5. **Delay Decision** ("We need more information" - valid!)

**If Delayed**:
- Factions accept reluctantly
- Thrane: "Don't wait too long. Danger follows these artifacts."
- Sets up Council Meeting Part 2 later

---

## Consequences by Choice

### If Flameguard Vault:
- Thrane: Ally (provides resources, protection)
- Mirabel: Disappointed but understanding
- Darius: Disapproves (not angry, but disagrees)
- Payment: 5,000 gp
- Codices stored, party can visit under guard

### If Return to Seal:
- Mirabel: Deeply grateful, becomes major ally
- The Bard: Approves, offers to accompany you
- Thrane: Respects decision (wishes she had them)
- Darius: Disagrees (wanted destruction)
- Transition directly to "Journey to Fractured Seal" scene

### If Church Destruction:
- Ritual attempted → **FAILS DRAMATICALLY**
- Codex burns with impossible heat, doesn't break
- Seal weakens catastrophically
- Mirabel: "I WARNED YOU!"
- Darius: Shaken, faith tested
- Must choose new option immediately

### If Keep Them:
- All three factions: Disappointed/concerned
- Political pressure increases
- Assassinations continue
- Party independence maintained (harder path)

---

## Scene Conclusion

**Thrane** (after decision):
> *"Your choice is noted. We'll honor it—for now. But understand: the world is watching. Choose wisely what you do next."*

**Mirabel** (if returning to seal):
> *"Thank you. Truly. I'll provide everything you need to know about the Fractured Seal. Come find me when you're ready."*

**Darius** (if keeping/vaulting):
> *"May the Light protect you from the consequences. I fear you'll need it."*

---

## Transition to Scene 4

**Read**:
> *The Council session ends. The three leaders file out, each to their own faction headquarters. You're left with your decision... and its weight.*
>
> *Outside, the celebration continues. But you know: assassins are coming, Varn is planning, and the seals are weakening.*
>
> *You have the rest of the afternoon to prepare. What will you do?*

**Tell Players**: "It's now about 4:30 PM in-game. You have free time before evening. Let's transition to Scene 4."
