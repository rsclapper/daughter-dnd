## Morning After

**Read**:
> *Dawn breaks over Embercross. You've had a few hours of rest—fitful, interrupted by nightmares of flames and whispers. But the morning brings clarity.*
>
> *The Codices must return to the Fractured Seal. Whatever else happens, the binding must be strengthened.*

**Party Status**:
- **Long Rest Available**: Full HP, spell slots restored
- **Supplies**: Can purchase rations, equipment
- **Allies**: The Bard offers to accompany (if party wants NPC support)

---

## Gathering Supplies (Quick Scene - 5 min)

**Shopping Opportunity** (last chance before ruins):
- Healing potions (50 gp)
- Rope, pitons, torches
- Rations (if traveling longer)
- Antitoxin, alchemist's fire

**The Bard** (if accompanying):
> *"I've been to ruins before. Bring rope—lots of rope. And light sources. Ancient places don't have convenient torches waiting."*

**Mirabel** (if visited):
- Provides **detailed map** to Fractured Seal
- Warns about Guardian: *"It will test you. Prove you're worthy."*
- Gives **Seal Fragment Pendant** (if not given earlier): Advantage on saves vs. fire 1/day

---

## The Journey Begins

**Read**:
> *You leave Embercross through the northern gate, following the trade road for five miles before turning east onto an old, overgrown path. The Codices grow warmer with each mile, as if recognizing the way home.*
>
> *The landscape changes. Farmland gives way to rocky hills, then to a wild ravine cutting through ancient stone. The air smells of sulfur and old magic.*
>
> *This place is old. Older than Embercross. Older than human kingdoms.*

---

## Travel Montage (Choose One)

### Option 1: Peaceful Journey (Quick, 10 min)

**Read**:
> *The journey takes six hours. You see no other travelers—this path is little-used, half-forgotten. Birds fall silent as you pass. Even the wind seems hesitant.*
>
> *But you make good time. By afternoon, you reach the ravine.*

**No Encounter**: Skip to arrival scene.

---

### Option 2: Skill Challenge (Moderate, 15 min)

**The Treacherous Path**:
> *The path narrows, winding along a cliff edge. Loose stones, hidden roots, and a sheer drop of 200 feet to the ravine floor below.*

**Skill Challenge** (3 successes before 2 failures):
- **DC 12 Athletics**: Climb over fallen rocks
- **DC 12 Acrobatics**: Balance on narrow ledge
- **DC 12 Survival**: Find safest route
- **DC 14 Perception**: Spot hazards before triggering

**Success**: Safe passage, reach ruins unharmed
**Failure**: 1d6 damage from fall (caught by rope), 1 hour delay

---

### Option 3: Encounter (Combat, 20 min)

**Guardians of the Path**:
> *Halfway there, you encounter them: four **Fire Elementals**, small but hostile. They emerge from volcanic vents, blocking your path.*
>
> **Elemental** (hisses in Ignan): *"Turn back. Mortals not welcome."*

**Combat Encounter**:
- **4 Fire Elementals** (Small variant: AC 13, HP 30 each, CR 2)
- **Total XP**: 1,800 (Medium encounter for level 7 party)
- **Terrain**: Rocky path, volcanic vents, cliff edge
- **Tactics**: Elementals use terrain, push toward cliff

**Alternate - Negotiation**:
- **Persuasion DC 16**: "We're returning the Codices to the seal"
- **Intimidation DC 14**: Show the Codices (they recognize power)
- **Success**: Elementals let party pass, even escort them

**Outcome**: Party arrives at ruins (perhaps wounded or depleted)

---

## Arrival at the Fractured Seal

**Read** (dramatic reveal):
> *The ravine opens before you—a massive wound in the earth, 300 feet deep. Ancient stone bridges span the gap, carved with glyphs that pulse with faint red light.*
>
> *At the ravine's heart, built into the cliff face itself, stand the ruins: three archways carved from black volcanic stone. Each is 40 feet tall, covered in script that hurts to read—words of binding, of imprisonment, of ancient pacts made in blood and fire.*
>
> *The central archway is cracked—the **Fractured Seal**. Reality seems thin there, wavering like heat shimmer. You can hear whispers, countless voices speaking in a language older than words.*
>
> *The Codices in your packs burn hot. They know. They remember.*
>
> *This is the place.*

---

## First Impressions

**Arcana Check**:
- **DC 10**: Incredibly powerful binding magic, still active after 12 centuries
- **DC 15**: The crack is growing—seal is failing
- **DC 20**: If the seal breaks completely, something vast will emerge

**History Check**:
- **DC 12**: This site predates all modern kingdoms
- **DC 16**: The Nine Seals were created here—this was ground zero
- **DC 19**: Twelve archmages performed the Great Binding; several died

**Perception Check**:
- **DC 12**: No signs of recent visitors (Varn hasn't been here)
- **DC 16**: Defensive wards still active (trap magic)
- **DC 20**: Something moves inside the ruins—something large

**Religion Check**:
- **DC 14**: This place is sacred—or profane, depending on perspective
- **DC 17**: The Entity imprisoned here was once worshipped as a god

## The Bard's Knowledge (If Present)

**The Bard**:
> *"According to legends, this place has a Guardian—a construct left by the archmages to protect the seal. It's supposed to test anyone who approaches."*
>
> *He looks nervous.*
>
> *"We're approaching. Be ready."*

---

## Approaching the Entrance

**Read**:
> *Three paths lead to the three archways:*
>
> *LEFT: Entrance Hall (safest, main path)*
> *CENTER: Fractured Seal (dangerous, unstable)*
> *RIGHT: Hall of Archmages (memorial, informative)*
>
> *Which way do you enter?*

**DM Note**: All paths lead to same central chamber eventually. See `Encounters/Fractured_Seal.md` for full details.

---

## Recommended Path (If Party Asks)

**Mirabel's Map** (if they have it):
- Recommends LEFT entrance (Entrance Hall)
- Warns against CENTER (unstable, might trigger collapse)
- Suggests visiting RIGHT after (lore and history)

**The Bard**:
> *"I'd say left—main entrance. Less likely to kill us immediately."*

---

## Transition to Scene 8

**Read** (as they enter):
> *You step through the archway. The temperature drops 20 degrees. Your breath mists. The whispers grow louder—not threatening, but present. Aware.*
>
> *Glyphs along the walls pulse with red light, illuminating a long corridor descending into darkness.*
>
> *Behind you, daylight seems distant. Ahead, mysteries wait.*

**Tell Players**: "Let's move to Scene 8—Exploring the Seal."

## DM Notes

**Energy Level**: MODERATE - Building tension
**Pace**: STEADY - Atmospheric, don't rush
**Music**: Journey music → Transition to ominous dungeon ambience

**Purpose**: This scene is a palette cleanser between intense combat (assassination) and upcoming challenges (seal puzzle, guardian). Use it to build atmosphere and let party catch their breath.

**Skippable Elements**:
- If running short on time, use Option 1 (Peaceful Journey)
- Focus on arrival and atmosphere
- The travel encounter can be cut entirely

**If Running Long**:
- Use montage narration instead of detailed travel
- Skip shopping scene
- Fast-forward to arrival

**Time Management**:
- Travel setup: 5 minutes
- Journey (chosen option): 10-20 minutes
- Arrival scene: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 20-30 minutes

**Common Questions**:
- Q: "Can we turn back?"
  - A: "Yes, but the seal is failing. Time is critical."

- Q: "What if we're not ready?"
  - A: "You can rest at the entrance. It's safe—for now."

- Q: "Do we have to fight the Guardian?"
  - A: The Bard: "Legends say it can be reasoned with. If you prove yourself worthy."

**Time Check**: Should be done by 7:15 PM
