---

## Phase 1: Testing (Rounds 1-3)

**Guardian's Tactics**:
1. **Round 1**: Assess threats (attacks frontliner, tests defenses)
2. **Round 2**: Focus fire on spellcaster (hammer strikes)
3. **Round 3**: Use environment (slam PC into pillar, lair actions)

**Goal**: Demonstrate power, test party's coordination

**Combat Narration**:
> *The Guardian moves with ancient purpose. Each strike is calculated, each defense precise. It's not trying to kill you—yet. It's measuring you.*

---

## Negotiation Opportunity (Round 4-5)

**When Party Proves Themselves** (Choose trigger):
- Party deals 50+ damage
- Party uses clever tactics
- Party shows coordination/teamwork
- Guardian's HP drops below 50%

**Guardian Pauses**:

**Read**:
> *The Guardian steps back, raising one massive hand.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"ENOUGH."*
>
> *Its eyes dim slightly. When it speaks again, the voice is less like grinding stone, more like ancient wisdom.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"You fight well. Coordinated. Purposeful. You are not mere looters. Speak—why have you come? What is your purpose?"*

**Negotiation Check**:

**Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation** (varies by approach):

**If Inserted Both Codices** (DC 12):
- Easy negotiation
- Guardian: *"You have already proven yourselves. I yield. Take my blessing."*
- Combat ends peacefully

**If Inserted One Codex** (DC 16):
- Moderate negotiation
- Must explain why they kept one
- Guardian: *"Your reasons are... understandable. But the third Codex must be retrieved. Swear you will complete the seal."*
- **Success**: Combat ends, Guardian makes them swear oath
- **Failure**: Combat resumes, but Guardian less hostile

**If Inserted Neither** (DC 20):
- Very hard negotiation
- Must have exceptional reason
- Guardian: *"Convince me you are not servants of the Flame."*
- **Success**: Guardian demands they insert at least one Codex NOW
- **Failure**: Combat resumes at full intensity

---

## Phase 2: All-Out Combat (If Negotiation Fails)

**Guardian Gets Serious**:

**Read**:
> *The Guardian's eyes flare bright red.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"SO BE IT. IF WORDS FAIL, STRENGTH WILL TEACH YOU."*

- Uses all Legendary Actions every round
- Focuses on downing weakest PC
- Summons maximum adds

---

## Tactical Combat Tips

**For Party**:
- **Destroy crystal veins** to stop regeneration (8 veins, 30 HP each, AC 14)
- **Use pillars for cover** (half cover, blocks line of sight)
- **Focus fire** (burst damage before regeneration)
- **Control adds** (don't let elementals swarm)
- **Environmental use** (push Guardian into hazards)

**For Guardian**:
- **Separate party** (slam to knock away)
- **Target priority**: Healers > Spellcasters > Martials
- **Use regeneration** (force party to burst damage)
- **Lair actions** to control battlefield
- **Legendary actions** to maintain pressure

---

## Victory Conditions

### Party Victory
**Guardian Reduced to 0 HP** or **Guardian Yields**

**If Defeated**:
> *The Guardian stumbles, then falls to one knee. Its crystal eyes dim.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"Enough. You have... proven yourselves. Warriors of worth."*
>
> *It doesn't shatter—it's a construct, designed to endure. But it bows.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"I yield. Take what wisdom I can offer."*

**If Negotiated**:
> *The Guardian nods slowly.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"Your oath is accepted. Complete the seal. Retrieve the third key. Do not fail."*

### Guardian Victory (Rare)
**Party Defeated** (all downed or fled)

**Guardian's Response**:
- Does NOT kill party (not its purpose)
- Takes Codices, inserts them into seal itself
- Teleports party outside ruins
- Bars re-entry

**Read**:
> *The Guardian stands over you. You expect the killing blow. It doesn't come.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"You are not worthy to bear the keys. I will seal them myself. Go. Do not return."*
>
> *Everything goes dark. When you wake, you're outside the ruins, bruised but alive. And the Codices are gone.*

**DM Note**: This is a "bad ending" for the scene, but not a TPK. Campaign continues, but harder path ahead.

## Post-Combat: Guardian's Wisdom

**If Party Won or Negotiated**:

**Guardian's Information**:
> **Guardian**: *"I have stood watch for twelve centuries. I know things your histories have forgotten."*

**Lore Drops**:
1. **The Entity**: "It was once worshipped as a god. Fire incarnate. It consumed cities for sport."
2. **The Binding**: "Twelve mages gave everything. Five died. Seven were crippled. But they succeeded."
3. **The Third Codex**: "Stolen, yes. By a thief named Varn. Fifty years past. His descendant likely holds it still."
4. **Varn's Plan**: "If he gathers all nine keys, the binding breaks. All seals collapse. The Flame rises."
5. **Time Pressure**: "With two keys restored, you have years. Without? Weeks. Find the third. Complete the seal."
6. **Other Seals**: "Eight more exist. All weakening. If this seal fails, all fail."

**Guardian's Gift** (if party proved worthy):

**Map of the Nine Seals**:
- Locations of all nine seals (plot hooks for future)
- Current status of each (most are weakening)
- Varn has leads on at least 3 others

**Seal Fragment** (magic item):
- Stone shard from Guardian's body
- **Effect**: Can summon Guardian once for aid (recharged at seal)
- **Rarity**: Very Rare

**Guardian's Blessing**:
- Each party member receives **Blessing of the Binding**
- +1 to saves against fire damage
- Advantage on checks related to seals

---

## XP Awards

**Combat XP**:
- Guardian defeated: 5,900 XP
- Minor Elementals (each): 100 XP
- **Total**: 6,000-6,600 XP ÷ party size

**Bonus XP**:
- Negotiated peacefully: +500 XP
- Destroyed crystal veins (tactics): +300 XP
- No party deaths: +200 XP
- Proved worthy: +400 XP

**Likely Result**: Party levels up to 8!

## Transition to Scene 10

**Read** (after receiving Guardian's wisdom):
> *The Guardian returns to its alcove, settling back into stone. Its eyes dim to embers.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"Go. Complete your quest. And know this: the Flame is patient. It has waited twelve centuries. It can wait a little longer... but not forever."*
>
> *The chamber falls silent. The seal—with your Codices inserted—glows softly. The crack has stopped growing. The whispers are quieter.*
>
> *But from deep within the seal, you hear a voice. Not the Guardian. Something else. Something ancient. Something vast.*
>
> *It speaks directly to your minds:*
>
> **"TWO KEYS RETURNED. ONE REMAINS WITH MY PROPHET. SOON, MORTAL CHILDREN. SOON."**

**Tell Players**: "Let's move to Scene 10—the final scene of tonight's session."

## DM Notes

**Energy Level**: EXTREME - Epic boss battle
**Pace**: INTENSE but managed
**Music**: Epic boss battle soundtrack

**This is the Climax**:
- Make it cinematic
- Describe every hit dramatically
- Use environment actively
- Allow creative tactics

**Combat Management**:
- Use timer for turns (keep pace)
- Track HP, legendary actions, lair actions on visible tracker
- Describe Guardian's "health" narratively (scratches, cracks, slowing)
- Keep adds from bogging down combat

**Time Management**:
- Combat should be 40-50 minutes
- Post-combat: 10 minutes
- If running long: Reduce HP or have Guardian yield early
- If running short: Add more adds or increase HP

**Make Difficulty Fair**:
- Adjust on the fly if needed
- Guardian can yield if party is clearly winning
- Guardian won't TPK—will knock unconscious, not kill
- Heroic victory should feel earned

**Common Questions**:
- Q: "Can we surrender?"
  - A: Guardian: "Insert the Codices, or fight. Choose."

- Q: "Can we destroy the seal?"
  - A: Guardian: "Try, and I will stop you with lethal force."

- Q: "What if we flee?"
  - A: Guardian blocks exit until Codices secured

**Time Check**: Should end by 9:00 PM

## Quick Reference

**Next Scene**: Cliffhanger & Wrap-Up (9:00 PM, 15 min)
**Mood Shift**: Epic combat → Ominous ending

**Critical**: This should be the emotional and mechanical climax of the session!
