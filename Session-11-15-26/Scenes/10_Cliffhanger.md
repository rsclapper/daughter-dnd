## The Entity Speaks

**After Guardian's final words, dramatic pause**

**Read** (slow, ominous):
> *The chamber grows colder. The glyphs on the seal pulse—red, then white, then red again. The Codices you inserted glow so brightly you have to look away.*
>
> *And then—*
>
> *A presence. Not physical. Not visible. But utterly, terrifyingly THERE.*
>
> *You feel it in your bones. In your blood. In the fire of your own life force. Something vast. Something ancient. Something that has waited in darkness for twelve hundred years.*
>
> *It speaks. Not with sound—with thought. Directly into your minds. Its voice is a thousand voices, all speaking as one. The voice of flame incarnate.*

**The Entity's Message**:

> **"AT LAST. MORTALS WHO UNDERSTAND."**
>
> **"TWO KEYS RETURNED. THE SEAL STRENGTHENS. BUT NOT ENOUGH. NEVER ENOUGH."**
>
> **"ONE KEY REMAINS WITH MY PROPHET. SOLRIC VARN. MY CHOSEN. MY VESSEL."**
>
> **"HE WILL BRING THE NINE TOGETHER. HE WILL FREE ME. AND WHEN I RISE, THE WORLD WILL BURN AS IT SHOULD HAVE BURNED TWELVE CENTURIES AGO."**
>
> **"YOU HAVE BOUGHT TIME, LITTLE HEROES. YEARS, PERHAPS. BUT TIME IS ALL YOU HAVE BOUGHT."**
>
> **"I AM PATIENT. I AM ETERNAL. I AM FLAME."**
>
> **"AND I AM WAKING."**

---

## The Vision (Optional - If You Want Maximum Drama)

**Read** (if using):
> *For one terrible moment, you SEE it. The Entity. Not as it is now—bound, imprisoned, fractured—but as it was. As it will be again if freed.*
>
> *A being of pure flame, taller than mountains. Eyes like dying stars. Hands that could cradle cities—or crush them. It strides across a landscape of ash and glass, and where it walks, reality itself burns.*
>
> *You see cities consumed. Oceans boiling. The sky itself aflame.*
>
> *Then the vision ends. You're back in the chamber, gasping, trembling. But you understand now: this isn't just about artifacts or villains or quests.*
>
> *This is about the apocalypse. And you just delayed it. For now.*

---

## Party Reactions (5 minutes)

**Allow players to react**:
- Roleplay their fear/determination
- Discuss what they just experienced
- Process the Entity's message

**The Bard** (if present, shaken):
> *"I've... I've chronicled wars. Plagues. Disasters. But this? This is... gods, we're in over our heads."*
>
> *He looks at you.*
>
> *"But you bought time. Years. That's more than anyone's managed in centuries. We can work with time."*

---

## The Seal's Response

**Read**:
> *The presence withdraws. The cold lifts. The glyphs return to their normal red glow.*
>
> *The seal stands, strengthened by your Codices. The crack has stopped spreading. The whispers are muted.*
>
> *The Guardian, from its alcove:*
>
> **Guardian**: *"You have done well. The seal will hold—for now. But the Entity speaks truth: Varn must be stopped. The third Codex must be retrieved. The nine must never gather."*
>
> *It pauses.*
>
> **Guardian**: *"Go. Rest. Prepare. Your true quest begins now."*

---

## Journey Back (Montage - 5 minutes)

**Read** (quick narration):
> *You leave the ruins as the sun sets. The journey back to Embercross takes hours, but you barely notice. Your minds are full of fire and prophecy.*
>
> *You reach the city gates as night falls. The guards recognize you, wave you through. You're heroes here. Saviors of Embercross.*
>
> *But you know the truth: You're not saviors. Not yet. You're just people who bought the world a little more time.*
>
> *As you walk through the familiar streets, you think about what comes next:*
>
> - **Varn has the third Codex**. He must be confronted.
> - **The Entity is waking**. It's not just imprisoned—it's aware, planning, speaking through Varn.
> - **Eight more seals** exist somewhere in the world, each weakening.
> - **The Flamebrand Covenant** cult serves the Entity.
> - **Time is limited**. Years, maybe. But not forever.

---

## Setting Up Next Session

**Read**:
> *You return to the Wayfarer's Rest Inn—now repaired after the assassination attempt. The innkeeper greets you warmly, offers you your rooms (no charge for heroes).*
>
> *As you settle in for the night, you each receive a message. The method varies—sending stone, messenger bird, whispered dream—but the content is the same:*
>
> **"Council of Three requests urgent meeting. New intelligence on Varn. Come immediately."**
>
> *This isn't over. It's only beginning.*

---

## The Cliffhanger (Final Narration)

**Read** (dramatic, final):
> *Across the city, in a warehouse shrouded in shadow, a figure stands before a map. Markers indicate nine locations—nine seals. Two are marked in red: STRENGTHENED.*
>
> *The figure—a man in expensive armor, bearing a hammer etched with flame—smiles.*
>
> **Varn**: *"So. They've returned two of the keys. How noble. How futile."*
>
> *He touches his chest, where a third Codex rests against his heart. It glows in response.*
>
> **Varn**: *"I have four more leads. Three more years, perhaps less. The Flame is patient. And so am I."*
>
> *He looks at the map, at the two red markers.*
>
> **Varn**: *"Let them feel like heroes. Let them believe they've won. It will make their despair sweeter when the bindings break and the world remembers: Fire is the true god. And gods do not forgive."*
>
> *The Codex pulses once, twice, three times. Like a heartbeat.*
>
> *Like something waking up.*

**Fade to black.**
