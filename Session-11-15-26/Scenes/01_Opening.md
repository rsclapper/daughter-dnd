## Opening Narration (READ THIS ALOUD)

*Read from index.md or use this version:*

> **"When the vault door slammed shut behind you, the world should've forgotten you. But fate—fickle, flame-kissed, and ever watching—had other plans."**
>
> **"You came seeking gold, artifacts, maybe a good story. But what you found was older than the city, deeper than the tunnels, and hotter than any forgefire. You emerged with more than loot… you brought back the Flamebound Codices—and they noticed you."**
>
> **"Now the city breathes differently. You saved Embercross from the Convergence Crisis. The streets sing your names. The Flameguard hails you as heroes. Merchants offer you their finest wares."**
>
> **"But the two Codices you carry whisper in the night. Their pages rearrange when you're not looking. And you've begun to realize: these aren't prizes. They're keys. Keys to something ancient. Something hungry. Something that's beginning to wake."**
>
> **"Three days after your victory, a formal invitation arrives. The Council of Three requests your presence. Three factions, three philosophies, three demands. Everyone wants the Codices."**
>
> **"But before that meeting, the city throws you a celebration. Today, you're heroes."**
>
> **"Tomorrow... well, that depends on the choices you make."**

- Q: "What do the whispers say?"
  - A: "You can't quite make it out. Like voices in a language you almost understand."

- Q: "Are we in danger?"
  - A: "Not immediately. But you have a sense that possessing these makes you a target."
