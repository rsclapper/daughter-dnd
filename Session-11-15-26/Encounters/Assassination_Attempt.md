## Variant Scenarios

### If Codices Are In Vault (Council Choice)

- Party hears alarm, respond
- Fight in/around Flameguard HQ
- Different terrain, more guards

**Outcome**:

- Thrane embarrassed but grateful
- May change party's opinion

### If Party Is Away from Inn

- More civilians at risk
- City watch responds faster
- Different terrain (market stalls, fountain)

**Ambush On Road** (Traveling to Fractured Seal):
- Wilderness terrain
- No reinforcements
- Harder to escape
- More isolated, scary

### If Party Set Elaborate Defenses

**Clever Party**:
- Alarm spells: Assassins trigger them
- Traps: Some assassins caught

- Guards: Hired NPCs help in combat

**Reward Preparation**:
- Give advantage on initiative
- Some assassins taken out before combat
- Reduce enemy numbers

## Aftermath Transitions

### Immediate Next Scene Options

**1. Investigation & Evidence Gathering** (This document)
**2. Council Follow-Up** (If choice changes)
**3. Rest & Recovery** (Long rest finally)
**4. Journey Preparation** (If going to Fractured Seal next)

### Setting Up Act 3: The Fractured Seal

**Regardless of Choices**:
- Party now knows Varn is enemy
- Codices are clearly dangerous to possess
- Fractured Seal becomes important (evidence points there)
- Urgency increases

**Transitional Beats**:
- "We can't stay here. Too exposed."
- "The seal is real. We've seen the evidence."
- "Varn won't stop. We need to end this."
- "Let's return the Codices and be done with this curse."
