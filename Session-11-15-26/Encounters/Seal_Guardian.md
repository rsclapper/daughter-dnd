## Special Abilities

### Immutable Form
The Guardian is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

### Magic Resistance
The Guardian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Siege Monster
The Guardian deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Archmage Vessel
The Guardian contains fragments of the twelve archmages' souls. It can channel their residual magic.

### Seal Connection
While in the Seal Chamber, the Guardian regains 20 HP at the start of its turn if the seal is intact. This regeneration stops if the seal is destroyed (don't let players do this!).

### Codex Sense
The Guardian can sense the location of any Codex within 120 feet and knows if a bearer intends harm to the seal.

### Phase Shift (Recharge 5-6)
As a bonus action, the Guardian can become incorporeal until the start of its next turn. While incorporeal:
- Can move through walls and creatures
- Immune to all damage except force and radiant
- Cannot make attacks
- Used for repositioning

---

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Guardian makes three attacks: two Crushing Fists and one Crystal Lance. Alternatively, it can use Seal Pulse instead of one attack.

### Crushing Fist
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 18). The Guardian has two fists and can grapple two creatures.

### Crystal Lance
*Ranged Spell Attack*: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 22 (4d8 + 3) force damage. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Seal Pulse (Recharge 5-6)
The Guardian channels energy from the seal. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures holding Codices have advantage on this save.

### Archmage Echo (1/Day)
The Guardian channels the voice of the twelve archmages. All creatures in the chamber must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, creatures are stunned until the end of the Guardian's next turn as they experience the archmages' final moments. On a successful save, creatures are unaffected.

---

## Bonus Actions

### Guardian's Judgment (1/Day)
The Guardian points at one creature it can see within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be marked. While marked (lasts 1 minute):
- Guardian's attacks against the marked creature have advantage
- Marked creature has disadvantage on attacks against the Guardian
- Mark ends if the creature proves their worthiness through actions (DM discretion)

### Recall Crystal (Recharge 5-6)
The Guardian extends its hand toward one Codex it can see within 60 feet. The bearer must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the Codex is pulled from their grasp and flies into the Guardian's hand.

---

## Reactions

### Seal Defense
When a creature damages the seal structure itself (the pedestal, keyholes, etc.), the Guardian can use its reaction to move up to its speed toward that creature and make one Crushing Fist attack with advantage.

### Crystal Shield
When hit by an attack, the Guardian can use its reaction to gain +5 AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The crystal veins in its body flash brightly.

---

## Legendary Actions (3 per round)

The Guardian can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Guardian regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Move
The Guardian moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Crystal Shard (Costs 1 Action)
The Guardian launches a crystal shard at one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) piercing damage.

### Arcane Binding (Costs 2 Actions)
The Guardian targets one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained by magical stone tendrils rising from the floor. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The tendrils have AC 18 and 30 HP.

### Seal Resonance (Costs 3 Actions)
The Guardian resonates with the seal, causing the entire chamber to shake. All creatures except the Guardian must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 18 (4d8) force damage.

---

## Lair Actions (On Initiative Count 20)

While in the Seal Chamber, the Guardian can invoke lair actions:

**1. Crystal Growth**
Crystals erupt from the floor in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the Guardian can see. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) piercing damage.

**2. Archmage Whispers**
The voices of the twelve archmages echo through the chamber. One creature the Guardian can see must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the Guardian until initiative count 20 on the next round. While charmed, the creature must use its movement to get as close as possible to the seal (but won't harm itself).

**3. Seal Illumination**
The seal flares with light. All creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. Creatures with the Codices in their possession have advantage on this save.

---

## Combat Tactics by Scenario

### Scenario A: Party Inserted Both Codices (Moderate Difficulty)

**Guardian's Demeanor**: Respectful but must test worthiness

**Opening Dialogue**:
> "Keybearers... you have acted... honorably... But the seal... demands... proof of strength... Defend... yourselves..."

**Combat Tactics**:
- Starts at 75% aggression (pulling punches)
- Uses Crushing Fist to grapple, not kill
- Targets strongest party member first (testing their champion)
- Uses Crystal Lance to keep casters honest
- Avoids using Seal Pulse early (too dangerous)
- After party proves themselves (reduces Guardian to 50% HP OR impressive tactics):
  - "Enough... you are... worthy... the seal... accepts you..."
  - Combat ends, Guardian becomes neutral/helpful

**Victory Condition for Party**:
- Reduce Guardian to 50% HP (prove strength) OR
- Survive 5 rounds (prove endurance) OR
- Successfully defend all party members (prove teamwork)

**What "Proving Worthy" Means**:
- Guardian stops attacking
- Provides blessing (see rewards)
- Answers questions about seal/Entity
- Becomes long-term ally

---

### Scenario B: Party Inserted One Codex (Hard Difficulty)

**Guardian's Demeanor**: Concerned and stern

**Opening Dialogue**:
> "One key... returned... insufficient... Explain... your intentions... or... surrender... the second..."

**Negotiation Opportunity**:
- DC 16 Persuasion: "We need the other to find the third Codex"
- Success: Guardian allows it, but marks them with Guardian's Judgment
- Failure: Combat begins

**Combat Tactics** (If negotiation fails):
- Full aggression (100%)
- Prioritizes Recall Crystal to take second Codex
- Targets Codex bearer relentlessly
- Uses Arcane Binding to restrain bearer
- Uses Seal Pulse frequently
- Fights to subdue, not kill (wants to insert Codex themselves)

**Victory Condition for Party**:
- Defeat Guardian (reduce to 0 HP) OR
- Convince mid-combat (DC 18 Persuasion during fight) OR
- Insert the second Codex (Guardian stops immediately)

**If Guardian Wins**:
- Takes second Codex forcibly
- Inserts it into seal
- Releases party alive: "Go... find... the third... return it... or the seal... fails..."

---

### Scenario C: Party Kept Both Codices (Deadly Difficulty)

**Guardian's Demeanor**: Hostile, views party as threat

**Opening Dialogue**:
> "You... refuse... UNWORTHY... The seal... must be... protected... Surrender... the keys... or... PERISH..."

**Combat Tactics**:
- Maximum aggression (125% - adds reinforcements)
- Uses Archmage Echo immediately (stun opener)
- Marks both Codex bearers with Guardian's Judgment
- Relentless Recall Crystal attempts
- Full use of Legendary Actions
- **Lair Reinforcement**: On round 3, stone elementals rise (2x Earth Elementals, CR 5 each)

**Victory Condition for Party**:
- Defeat Guardian AND elementals (brutal fight) OR
- Insert at least one Codex mid-combat (Guardian stops) OR
- Escape the chamber (difficult, Guardian blocks exit)

**If Party Flees**:
- Guardian pursues for 1 minute, then returns to seal
- Party still has Codices but Guardian now hunts them
- Will attack them on sight if they return

**If Guardian Wins**:
- Takes both Codices by force
- Inserts them into seal
- May kill party if they resist (rolls to subdue first)
- If party surrenders: Releases them alive with warning

**Vision** (while stunned):
> *You see through the eyes of an archmage. Twelve of you stand in a circle, hands joined. Before you, a being of pure flame writhes and screams. "You cannot hold me! I AM ETERNAL!" Your body burns as your soul is drawn from it, fuel for the binding spell. Pain beyond imagining. And then... nothing. Darkness. Awareness without existence. Forever bound to this seal, maintaining the prison. One hundred years of this. Will you endure?*

## Negotiation During Combat

- "The Entity wants us to fight!" (Point out manipulation)

**Guardian's Response** (If Convinced):
- Stops attacking
- "Speak... quickly... Why should... I trust you?"
- Further negotiation (DC 14 Persuasion)
- Can end combat peacefully

**Failed Negotiation**:
- "Words... are insufficient... PROVE your worth... through STRENGTH!"
- Combat continues

- Use all Legendary Actions every round
- More frequent Seal Pulse
- Lair Actions more dangerous

**For Lower Level Party** (5-6):

- Fewer Lair Actions

**For Higher Level Party** (9-10):

**Epic Moments**:
- PC gets grappled, hoisted 15 ft in air

- Guardian yields, kneeling before party

**Emotional Beats**:
- Fear when Guardian first rises

- Awe at archmage visions
- Respect when Guardian yields
- Pride when deemed worthy

### The Bigger Picture

**This Fight Matters Because**:
- Tests party's values (protect seal vs take power)
- Provides critical lore (archmages' sacrifice)
- Sets up Varn confrontation (he has third Codex)
- Establishes party as "Keybearers" (campaign identity)
- Creates time pressure (2-4 years to find third Codex)

**Long-Term Consequences**:

- **If Seal Ignored**: Entity grows stronger
- **If Guardian Killed**: Seal undefended, vulnerable
- **If Party Proven Worthy**: Guardian becomes ally

## Cliffhanger Ending (After Combat)

### The Revelation

**After Guardian Defeated/Yields**:

> *As the Guardian falls silent - whether in defeat or acceptance - you approach the seal. Two Codices now rest in their slots, glowing with renewed purpose. The fracture has shrunk but not closed. The third slot remains empty.*
>
> *That's when you see it. Carved into the stone beneath the third keyhole, letters weathered but readable:*
>
> **"THE ASH CODEX - Taken by Koreth Varn, 1426"**
>
> *The Bard's voice breaks the silence: "Varn. It's always been Varn."*
>
> *And then, from the seal itself, a presence awakens. Not the Guardian. Not the archmages. Something older. Darker. Stronger.*
>
> *The Entity's voice, no longer muffled by distance, speaks directly to you:*
>
> **"Two keys returned. One remains with my prophet. How... delicious. The game continues, Keybearers. And I... am... patient."**
>
> *A pause. And then, with horrifying amusement:*
>
> **"After all this time... visitors. How... delightful."**
>
> *The voice fades. The chamber is silent except for your breathing and the faint pulse of the seal. You've bought time - years, perhaps. But the truth is clear:*
>
> *This isn't over. It's just beginning.*

**END OF SESSION**
