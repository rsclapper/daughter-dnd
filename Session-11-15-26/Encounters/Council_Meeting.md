# The Council of Three - Political Encounter

## Overview
**Type**: Roleplay / Negotiation / Political Drama
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty**: Complex (no "correct" answer)
**Objective**: Three factions vie for control of the Codices; party must decide

---

## Setting the Scene

### Location: Embercross Council Chamber
- Large circular room with vaulted ceiling
- Three elevated seats arranged in a triangle (faction representatives)
- Central floor space for speakers (where party stands)
- Gallery seating for observers (The Bard, citizens, guards)
- Natural acoustics make every word audible
- Sunlight streams through stained glass, creating dramatic lighting

### Atmosphere
- **Formal**: This is official city business
- **Tense**: All three factions desperately want the Codices
- **Public**: Gallery is full of citizens watching
- **Pressure**: Party is center of attention, all eyes on them

### Opening Description

*Read or paraphrase:*

> *The Council Chamber falls silent as you enter. Three figures sit in elevated seats, arranged in a triangle around you. To your left, Councilor Thrane Brightshield in his Flameguard armor, hand resting on his sword pommel. To your right, High Priest Darius Lightbringer grips his sun medallion, eyes burning with conviction. And ahead, Mirabel of the Ember Archive, amber eyes studying you with a century of wisdom.*
>
> *Behind you, the gallery murmurs - dozens of citizens, The Bard scribbling notes frantically, guards standing at attention. This is not a private negotiation. This is political theater.*
>
> *Thrane speaks first, his voice carrying military authority: "Heroes of Embercross, you saved this city from the Convergence. Today, we ask you to complete that salvation. The Flamebound Codices you carry are too dangerous for any individual to possess. The Council has convened to determine their proper stewardship."*
>
> *Darius stands, robes billowing: "Stewardship? DESTRUCTION! The Eternal Light demands-"*
>
> *Mirabel's calm voice cuts through: "Gentlemen. Perhaps we should let our heroes speak first?"*
>
> *All eyes turn to you. What do you say?*

## The Three Factions

### Faction 1: The Flameguard (Councilor Thrane Brightshield)

**Position**: Lock the Codices in the Flameguard Vault

**Opening Statement**:
*"The Flameguard has protected Embercross for fifty years without a single vault breach. Our vault is magically warded, physically impenetrable, and guarded day and night. We offer transparent, accountable custody. The Codices will be secured but available for supervised study. We will pay you five thousand gold for this service and provide permanent protection for your persons."*

**Key Arguments**:
1. **Security**: "Our track record speaks for itself"
2. **Accountability**: "We answer to the people, not shadows or dogma"
3. **Practicality**: "You can't adventure with targets on your backs"
4. **Compensation**: "Fairest payment and ongoing support"

**Weaknesses**:
- Doesn't understand magic deeply
- Vault could be insider threat (unknown to him)
- Overconfident in physical security

**Persuasion Style**: Professional, respectful, appeals to pragmatism

---

### Faction 2: The Ember Archive (Mirabel)

**Position**: Return the Codices to the Fractured Seal where they belong

**Opening Statement**:
*"One hundred years ago, twelve archmages gave their lives to create the Nine Seals that imprison the Ancient Fire Entity. The Codices are not prizes to be locked away or destroyed - they ARE the seals themselves. Remove them from their anchors, and the Entity grows stronger. I have spent a century guarding this truth. The Fractured Seal, fifteen miles northeast, desperately needs these two Codices returned. Only then will the prison hold."*

**Key Arguments**:
1. **Historical Truth**: "I was there at the Great Binding. I know the seals' purpose"
2. **Cosmic Stakes**: "Every day they're separated weakens ALL nine seals"
3. **Proven Knowledge**: "I've maintained other seals for a century successfully"
4. **Urgency**: "The Fractured Seal is the primary lock. It cannot wait"

**Weaknesses**:
- Asks them to trust secret organization
- Cannot "prove" seal theory without risking approach
- No monetary compensation (can only offer knowledge/resources)

**Persuasion Style**: Calm, authoritative, appeals to bigger picture

---

### Faction 3: The Church of Eternal Light (High Priest Darius)

**Position**: Destroy the Codices through holy consecration

**Opening Statement**:
*[Standing dramatically]* *"These artifacts are remnants of the Calamity that nearly ended our world! They whisper corruption, they draw evil, they poison the souls of their bearers! I have seen dark magic consume entire villages. I buried my own family in cursed ashes. The only safe Codex is ASH. Let the Church perform the Rite of Purification. Let the Eternal Light burn away this darkness before it consumes us all!"*

**Key Arguments**:
1. **Moral Imperative**: "Evil artifacts corrupt even heroes"
2. **Historical Pattern**: "Every time we 'preserve' dark magic, catastrophe follows"
3. **Permanent Solution**: "Can't steal what doesn't exist"
4. **Divine Mandate**: "The Light itself commands their destruction"

**Weaknesses**:
- Fundamentalist, won't compromise
- Least resources of three factions
- Destruction might actually break seals (he doesn't know this)

**Persuasion Style**: Passionate, emotional, appeals to morality and fear

---

## Encounter Structure

### Phase 1: Opening Statements (10 minutes)
Each faction presents their case (already written above)

**DM Role**:
- Deliver each statement with appropriate voice/emotion
- Show body language (Thrane: military, Mirabel: calm, Darius: passionate)
- Let party absorb information
- Gauge initial reactions

### Phase 2: Cross-Examination (15 minutes)
Factions debate each other and answer party questions

**Dynamic Interactions**:

**Thrane vs. Darius**:
- Thrane: "Destruction is permanent. We can study them safely in the vault."
- Darius: "Your vault didn't exist during the Calamity. These artifacts did."

**Mirabel vs. Thrane**:
- Mirabel: "A vault is a static target. The Seals are hidden across the realm."
- Thrane: "Hidden by a secret society no one can verify. We operate in the light."

**Darius vs. Mirabel**:
- Darius: "The Seals failed once! They'll fail again! Only fire can purge this evil!"
- Mirabel: "The Seals have held for a century. Breaking them through destruction would free the Entity immediately."

**Party Questions**:
Encourage party to ask questions. Each NPC responds according to their character (see NPC files).

### Phase 3: Private Consultations (10 minutes)
Allow party to request private conversations with any faction rep

**Options**:
- Take one faction rep aside for whispered conversation
- Call recess to discuss among themselves
- Ask The Bard (in gallery) for advice
- Cast Zone of Truth or other magic

**NPC Behavior During Recess**:
- Thrane: Speaks quietly with Flameguard guards
- Mirabel: Meditates, touches her ember crystal
- Darius: Prays fervently, grips medallion
- Professor Maellin (outside): Tries to approach party

### Phase 4: Decision (10 minutes)
Party announces their choice (or proposes alternative)

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Accept Flameguard Offer**: Codices go to vault
2. **Ally with Mirabel**: Journey to Fractured Seal
3. **Give to Church**: Destruction ritual (will fail dramatically)
4. **Keep Them**: Refuse all factions (political fallout)
5. **Alternative Solution**: Party proposes creative option
6. **Delay Decision**: Request more time (factions react)

### Phase 5: Consequences (5-10 minutes)
Immediate reactions and next steps

---

## Skill Challenges

### Understanding the Factions
**DC 12 Insight** (on each representative):
- **Thrane**: Genuinely believes vault is safest, proud of Flameguard record
- **Mirabel**: Desperately trying to prevent catastrophe, century of burden showing
- **Darius**: Traumatized by past, genuinely fears corruption

**DC 16 Insight** (deeper):
- **Thrane**: Frustrated by inability to protect against magical threats, needs this win
- **Mirabel**: Knows something she's not saying about vault security
- **Darius**: His trauma drives decisions, not necessarily logic

**DC 20 Insight** (secret thoughts):
- **Thrane**: Worried Flameguard reputation will suffer if he fails
- **Mirabel**: Would steal the Codices non-lethally if party refuses
- **Darius**: Planning to destroy them himself if they go to vault

### Detecting Deception
**DC 15 Insight** (Zone of Truth or similar):
- All three are telling the truth as they understand it
- Mirabel knows more than she's sharing but isn't lying
- Darius's "divine mandate" is his interpretation, not literal voice

### Verifying Claims
**DC 12 History**: Flameguard vault has never been breached (verified)
**DC 14 History**: Great Binding happened 100 years ago (verified)
**DC 16 Arcana**: Mirabel's seal theory is magically sound (plausible)
**DC 18 Religion**: Church has destroyed artifacts before (some successfully, some catastrophically)

### Negotiation and Persuasion
**DC 13 Persuasion**: Get faction to answer honestly
**DC 16 Persuasion**: Get faction to acknowledge weakness in their plan
**DC 19 Persuasion**: Get faction to support alternative solution

**DC 14 Intimidation**: Make faction desperate (backfires - they double down)
**DC 17 Deception**: Lie convincingly (risky, if caught trust is destroyed)

## NPC Reactions to Party Decision

### If Party Chooses: Flameguard Vault

**Thrane** (Satisfied):
- "You've made the wise choice. The contract will be drawn immediately."
- Honors all promises: 5,000 gold, protection, visiting rights
- Becomes reliable ally

**Mirabel** (Disappointed but Respectful):
- "I pray you are right. But know that I will continue watching the seals."
- Leaves contact information: "When you see I was correct, find me."
- Does NOT become enemy, but relationship is strained

**Darius** (Devastated):
- "You have doomed us all. The Light weeps."
- Storms out dramatically
- Begins public sermons condemning the decision
- May attempt vault infiltration later

**Professor Maellin** (If present):
- Relieved he might get supervised study access
- Warns about Varn: "He won't stop because they're locked away"

**The Bard** (If present):
- "Well, that's one way to handle it. Hope the vault holds!"
- Still offers information about Fractured Seal

---

### If Party Chooses: Return to Fractured Seal (Mirabel)

**Mirabel** (Grateful and Relieved):
- "You have saved countless lives today. Thank you."
- Immediately begins planning journey
- Provides full resources and knowledge
- Becomes loyal patron and ally

**Thrane** (Concerned but Professional):
- "I hope you know what you're doing. The offer stands if you change your mind."
- Assigns Flameguard escort "for your protection" (also to monitor)
- Remains professional ally

**Darius** (Conflicted):
- "Better the seals than a vault... but destruction is the only true answer."
- Performs blessing on party before they leave
- "May the Light protect you from corruption."

**The Bard** (Excited):
- "Yes! I've been researching the Fractured Seal!"
- Offers to come along (or at minimum provides detailed notes)
- This becomes Act 3 of the session

---

### If Party Chooses: Destruction (Darius)

**Darius** (Ecstatic):
- "The Light has returned! You are TRUE heroes!"
- Falls to knees weeping
- Immediately begins preparing consecration ritual

**Mirabel** (Horrified):
- "NO! You don't understand! Destroying them will-"
- Attempts to stop ritual (conflict possible)
- "I cannot let you doom the world!"

**Thrane** (Skeptical):
- "Are you certain about this? Destruction is... permanent."
- Attends ritual with guards (in case something goes wrong)

**THE RITUAL** (Dramatic Event):
1. Church ceremony, 3 hours
2. Holy flame engulfs Codices
3. Entity's voice SCREAMS from within
4. Codices RESIST destruction
5. **REVELATION**: Cannot be destroyed - they ARE the seals
6. Ritual fails, nearly breaks seals instead
7. Darius must reckon with being wrong
8. Crisis narrowly averted

**After Failed Ritual**:
- Darius: Crushed, questions everything OR doubles down
- Mirabel: "I TOLD YOU. Now will you listen?"
- Thrane: "Well. The vault is still an option."
- Party must choose new option

---

### If Party Chooses: Keep the Codices

**All Three Factions** (United in Opposition):
- Thrane: "Then you are a threat to Embercross. Guards will monitor you."
- Mirabel: "You doom us all. I will track you and take them when you fail."
- Darius: "The darkness has claimed you already!"

**Consequences**:
- Political pressure from all sides
- Surveillance by Flameguard
- Public opinion turns (sermons, rumors)
- Harder to operate in Embercross
- Assassination attempt still happens (maybe intensified)

**Advantages**:
- Party maintains control
- Can study Codices themselves
- Freedom to choose later
- No faction favored

**The Bard** (If present):
- "Bold choice. Hope you can handle the heat."
- Still provides Fractured Seal information
- "Just saying, returning them might reduce the target on your back..."

## Alternative Solutions (Party Creativity)

### Possible Creative Solutions

**1. Distributed Custody**
- "One Codex to vault, one to seal"
- Compromise between factions
- Reactions: All factions partially satisfied/dissatisfied

**2. Temporary Vault, Then Seal**
- "Vault for study, then transfer to seal in 30 days"
- Allows research while planning seal journey
- Reactions: Thrane accepts, Mirabel reluctantly agrees, Darius opposes

**3. Party as Neutral Guardians**
- "We'll guard them independently with oversight"
- Request resources without giving up control
- Reactions: Factions skeptical but might agree to trial period

**4. Seal One, Study One**
- "Return damaged one to seal, keep stable one for research"
- Assumes one is more corrupted than other
- Reactions: Mirabel agrees to this, others consider

**5. Public Study Commission**
- "Create neutral committee with representatives from all three"
- Democratic solution
- Reactions: Bureaucratic nightmare but politically savvy

**6. Delay for More Information**
- "Give us 24 hours to research and decide"
- Reasonable request
- Reactions: Factions agree but tensions rise

### DM Guidance on Alternatives
**Encourage Creativity**: Reward creative solutions
**Logical Consequences**: Every choice has trade-offs
**NPC Flexibility**: Factions can compromise if logic is sound
**No Perfect Answer**: All choices have downsides

### Handling Unexpected Choices
- **Yes, And...**: Build on player creativity

- **NPC Reactions**: Stay in character
- **Flexibility**: Prepared material is guide, not rails

### The Real Stakes
This encounter establishes:
- Party's values and priorities
- Political landscape going forward

*"Three factions, three philosophies, three paths. Choose wisely, heroes. Or don't. Wisdom is knowing that all paths lead through fire."*
- Mirabel, after the Council adjourned
