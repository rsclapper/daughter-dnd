### Arrival at the Ravine

**Description**:
> *The forest opens to a rocky ravine, its walls scarred with ancient tool marks. At the ravine's base, half-buried in earth and time, stands a structure that predates Embercross by centuries. Massive stone blocks, each carved with intricate glyphs that pulse faintly in rhythm with the Codices you carry. An entrance yawns like a mouth in the cliff face, darkness within.*
>
> *The air here feels... wrong. Heavy. The Codices in your possession grow warm, almost eager. And from somewhere deep within the ruins, you hear it: a sound like breathing. Slow. Ancient. Waiting.*

**First Impressions**:
- Architecture is pre-Calamity (thousands of years old)
- Glyphs on walls match Codex symbols exactly
- Entrance shows signs of recent disturbance (Bard? Varn's scouts? Guardian patrols?)

**Ominous Details**:
- Scorch marks on stone (old, from Great Binding)

## Interior Layout

### Chamber 1: The Antechamber (Entry)

**Description**:
> *You step from daylight into cool stone silence. The antechamber is circular, 30 feet across, lit by softly glowing glyphs on the walls. The same symbols that cover the Codices dance across every surface. Three corridors lead deeper - left, right, and straight ahead. In the center of the room, a stone pedestal holds a crystal basin filled with water so clear it seems like glass.*

**Features**:
- **Glyph Walls**: Tell story of the Great Binding (pictures, not words)
- **Crystal Basin**: Scrying pool (shows other seal locations if used correctly)
- **Three Corridors**: Left (trapped), Right (trapped), Center (safe - marked by faint glow)
- **Ambient Magic**: Strong divination aura (DC 10 Detect Magic)

**Glyph Story** (If Party Studies Walls):
DC 12 Investigation or Arcana reveals story in images:
1. Ancient being of fire (the Entity)
2. Cities burning, people fleeing
3. Twelve figures joining hands (archmages)
4. Being imprisoned in nine locations
5. Nine books/codices as keys
6. Warning: bringing keys together breaks prison

**The Basin** (Optional Puzzle):
- Pour liquid from Codex near it (glowing page ink)
- Shows vision of all nine seal locations
- Reveals third Codex location (wherever you want plot to go)
- **Cost**: PC who uses it takes 1d8 psychic damage (Entity notices them)

**Corridor Choice**:
- **Left Path**: Trapped (pressure plates, poison darts)
- **Right Path**: Trapped (illusory floor over pit)
- **Center Path**: Safe, marked by Codex-resonance glow
- DC 14 Investigation: Notice center path's glyphs glow when Codex near

---

### Chamber 2: The Hall of Binding (Middle)

**Description**:
> *The corridor opens into a long hall, its vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. Twelve alcoves line the walls, six on each side. In each alcove stands a stone statue - archmages frozen in their final moments, hands raised in binding gestures. Their faces show determination, fear, sacrifice. At the hall's far end, a massive sealed door blocks the way, covered in chains made of pure light.*

**Features**:
- **Twelve Statues**: The archmages who created the Great Binding
- **Light Chains**: Magical barriers on the door
- **Floor Glyphs**: Path marked for safe passage
- **Echo Effect**: Whispers in the air (Entity's voice seeping through)

**The Statues** (If Examined):
Each statue has a plaque with a name and final words:

1. **Archmage Velanna**: "Let this sacrifice hold eternal"
2. **Archmage Theron**: "Nine seals for nine aspects of hunger"
3. **Archmage Mirabel** (Yes, THAT Mirabel's ancestor): "May those who come after guard what we bind"
4. [etc. - 12 total, you can create names]

DC 16 History or The Bard provides:
- "These twelve gave their lives to create the Nine Seals"
- "The binding consumed their souls as fuel for the prison"
- "Mirabel of the Ember Archive is descended from this Mirabel"
- "This wasn't a victory. It was desperate survival."

**The Light Chains** (Barrier Puzzle):
- Cannot be broken by force
- Must be opened by presenting Codices
- DC 14 Arcana: "Designed to recognize the Codices"
- When two Codices are held near door: chains part, door unseals

**The Whispers** (DC 13 Perception):
Faint voice speaking from beyond the door:
- "So long... alone..."
- "The keys return... freedom approaches..."
- "Warm blood... after such cold..."
- Entity is AWARE and AWAKENING

**Entity Compulsion** (Optional Challenge):
Party members carrying Codices make DC 13 WIS save or feel compelled to open door immediately
- Success: Resist urge, proceed carefully
- Failure: Strong desire to "just open it and see what's inside"
- The Bard or Mirabel (if present): "Fight it! The Entity is influencing you!"

---

### Chamber 3: The Seal Chamber (Final)

**Unlocking the Door**:
When Codices are presented, light chains dissolve, door swings open silently

**Description**:
> *The final chamber takes your breath away. Circular, vast, the ceiling a dome painted with constellations you've never seen. The floor is a mosaic - a great phoenix consuming itself in flame, eyes made of ruby that seem to track your movement. And in the chamber's center, rising from the floor like a throne of stone, stands the Seal itself.*
>
> *Three keyholes arranged in a triangle. Three indentations, precisely sized for the Codices. Currently: empty. All three empty.*
>
> *The Codices in your hands burn with urgency. They WANT to be placed. They're pulling toward the slots like lodestones to iron. And from the Seal itself, a sound: grinding stone. Something immense stirring below.*

**Features**:
- **The Seal**: Central stone pedestal with three triangular keyholes
- **Phoenix Mosaic**: Covers floor, eyes glow when Codices near
- **The Guardian Alcove**: Shadowed recess where Guardian sleeps
- **Crystal Veins**: Run through walls, pulsing with contained power
- **The Fracture**: Visible crack in Seal (third Codex has been missing too long)

---

## The Seal: Main Puzzle

### Current State of the Seal

**Observation** (Automatic upon entering):
- Three keyholes in triangular arrangement
- ALL THREE EMPTY
- Visible crack running through center (the "fracture")
- Magic is failing (DC 10 Arcana to sense)

**The Bard's Realization** (If present):
- "Oh no. Oh NO."
- "Two keys, three locks. We don't have enough."
- "The third Codex... it's been missing for..."

**Mirabel's Knowledge** (If present or contacted):
- "The third Codex was lost fifty years ago"
- "Last seen in [location you want next adventure to be]"
- "Without all three, the Fractured Seal will fail within months"

### Puzzle: What To Do?

**The Question**: Party has two Codices, but Seal needs three. What do they do?

**Option 1: Insert Both Codices**
- Restores 66% of seal power
- Buys time (months instead of weeks)
- Locks Codices in place (they're part of the seal now)
- Guardian awakens to test their worthiness

**Option 2: Insert One Codex**
- Restores 33% of seal power
- Buys some time (weeks)
- Party keeps one Codex (risky)
- Guardian awakens anyway (senses disturbance)

**Option 3: Insert Neither**
- Seal continues deteriorating
- Party keeps both Codices
- Guardian awakens hostile (protecting failing seal)
- Irresponsible choice, consequences severe

**Option 4: Attempt to Repair Seal Without Full Keys**
- DC 20 Arcana + DC 18 Religion
- Temporary magical patch
- Buys 1-2 weeks maximum
- Guardian awakens to "assist" or stop them

**Option 5: Research First**
- Examine the chamber thoroughly
- Look for clues about third Codex
- Learn seal mechanics
- THEN decide (Guardian stays dormant a bit longer)

### Skill Challenges (Research Option)

**DC 12 Investigation** (Examining Seal):
- Three indentations are labeled: "Flame," "Ash," "Ember"
- Party has "Flame" and "Ember"
- "Ash" is missing

**DC 14 Arcana** (Understanding Magic):
- Seal is binding magic, not destruction magic
- Codices ARE the seal, not keys to destroy it
- Removing Codices weakens prison
- Inserting Codices strengthens prison

**DC 16 History** (Floor Mosaic):
- Phoenix symbolism: Three states of the Entity
- Flame (active), Ember (dormant), Ash (weakest)
- Three Codices represent three attempts to bind it
- All three needed for complete prison

**DC 18 Religion** (Crystal Veins):
- Divine magic woven into structure
- The twelve archmages' souls are IN the seal
- They're still "alive" in a sense, maintaining the binding
- Disrupting seal would destroy their sacrifice

**DC 20 Arcana** (The Fracture):
- Fracture is growing 1 inch per month
- At current rate: Seal fails completely in 4-6 months
- Inserting two Codices: Slows to 1 inch per year (buys years)
- Inserting three Codices: Fracture repairs, seal restored

### The Bard's Historical Knowledge

**If Party Asks for Help**:
- "My research said this seal was the strongest, but most complex"
- "It's called the Fractured Seal because it requires three keys maintained"
- "Records say the third Codex was stolen during a cult raid fifty years ago"
- "Rumor placed it in [next adventure location]"
- "Without all three... we're just buying time."

## The Decision & Consequences

### If Party Inserts Both Codices

**Process**:
1. Place first Codex ("Flame") in its slot
2. Seal glows, accepts it, Codex merges with stone
3. Place second Codex ("Ember") in its slot
4. Seal glows brighter, fracture shrinks but doesn't close
5. Third slot ("Ash") remains empty, fracture still visible
6. Guardian begins to awaken (sensors detect Codex placement)

**Mechanical Effect**:
- Seal strengthened significantly
- Entity's influence in region diminishes
- Buying 2-4 YEARS before seal fails
- Party no longer has Codices (they're integrated into seal)
- Quest hook: Find the third Codex before time runs out

**Narrative Effect**:
- **Entity's Reaction** (Voice from seal): "Two... not three... insufficient... but PAINFUL..."
- Entity is hurt but not defeated
- Varn's plans are disrupted (he needed those Codices)
- Mirabel grateful: "You've bought the world precious time"

**The Guardian Awakens** (Next encounter):
- Approaches calmly, not hostile
- "Keybearers... you have chosen... wisely..."
- Tests their resolve (combat, but can be negotiated with)

### If Party Inserts One Codex

**Process**:
1. Place one Codex in any slot
2. Seal accepts it reluctantly
3. Fracture shrinks slightly but instability remains
4. Guardian awakens confused and concerned

**Mechanical Effect**:
- Seal strengthened minimally
- Buying weeks to months
- Party keeps one Codex (still targeted)
- Questionable decision

**The Guardian Awakens** (Hostile):
- "Incomplete offering... unworthy..."
- Attacks to reclaim second Codex
- Can be persuaded (DC 18) to accept temporary arrangement

### If Party Inserts Neither

**Process**:
1. Party refuses to place Codices
2. Seal continues failing
3. Entity's voice grows louder
4. Guardian awakens VERY hostile

**Mechanical Effect**:
- Seal continues deteriorating
- Party keeps both Codices
- Worst choice mechanically
- All NPCs disappointed/angry

**The Guardian Awakens** (Hostile):
- "Keybearers refuse... UNWORTHY..."
- Attacks to take Codices by force
- No negotiation possible
- Hardest combat difficulty

## Roleplay Moments

### The Bard's Character Moment

**If They Came Along**:
- Overwhelmed by historical significance
- "I'm standing where the Great Binding happened..."
- Wants to document everything
- Offers historical context constantly
- "Do you realize what you're doing? You're finishing what began a century ago!"

**Emotional Beat**:
- If party inserts Codices: Tears of joy, begins composing epic ballad
- If party refuses: Devastated, pleads with them to reconsider
- If party succeeds: "I witnessed history today. Thank you for letting me be here."

### Mirabel's Arrival (If She Followed)

**Dramatic Entrance** (After party has explored):
- Enters as party is deciding what to do
- "I hoped you'd come here. I see you've discovered the truth."
- Provides context and encouragement
- "My ancestor gave her life for this seal. Let me help you restore it."

**If Present During Decision**:
- Advocates strongly for inserting both Codices
- "Temporary inconvenience for the world's safety"
- Reveals she knows location of third Codex (next quest)
- "Trust me. Please. I've waited a century for this."

### Professor Maellin's Sacrifice (If He Came)

**Optional Dramatic Moment**:
- If Maellin somehow came (desperate to study the seal)
- Realizes his wasting sickness is FROM Codex exposure
- Sees the archmages' sacrifice in the crystal veins
- Makes choice: "I've studied death magic my whole life. Let me be part of something that creates life."
- Volunteers to add his magic to seal (dies, but heroically)
- Buys extra time if party only has two Codices

---

## The Guardian Awakens (Transition)

**Regardless of Party Choice, Guardian Activates**:

> *The moment the Codex touches the seal - or the moment you decide not to place them - the chamber trembles. From the shadowed alcove, stone grinds against stone. The Guardian rises.*
>
> *Fifteen feet tall, humanoid but clearly not human. Constructed from the same ancient stone as the chamber, veins of crystal running through its body like blood vessels. Its face is blank except for two glowing eye-sockets that burn with the same light as the seal. When it speaks, the voice is like grinding millstones, layered with echoes of the twelve archmages.*
>
> *"Keybearers... You have returned... Speak... your... purpose..."*

**Guardian's Demeanor Based on Party Choice**:
- **Two Codices Inserted**: Respectful, testing, not immediately hostile
- **One Codex Inserted**: Concerned, questioning, ready to fight if needed
- **No Codices**: Hostile, will fight to claim them
- **Attempted Theft/Damage**: VERY hostile, attacks immediately

**The Challenge**:
> *"The Sealbearers... must prove... worthy... Defend... your choice..."*

**Transition to Combat** (See Seal_Guardian.md):
- Initiative rolled
- Guardian's combat stats activate
- Different tactics based on party's choice
- Can be negotiated with OR fought

### The Great Binding (Historical Text)
*If party researches in Embercross library before coming*

---
**THE GREAT BINDING: A Historical Account**

One hundred years ago, when the Entity threatened to consume our world, twelve archmages enacted a desperate plan. Unable to destroy the being, they instead imprisoned it using the most powerful binding magic ever crafted.

The Entity was separated into nine aspects, each sealed in a different location. Nine Codices were created as both locks and keys - remove them, and the seals weaken. Replace them, and the prison holds.

The primary seal, known as the Fractured Seal, requires three Codices to maintain. It is both the strongest and most vulnerable of the nine. Should it fail, the other eight will collapse in time.

The cost was the lives and souls of the twelve archmages, who bound themselves into the seal as eternal guardians.

*Author's note: May their sacrifice never be forgotten.*

---

### Inscription Translation (Handout)
*What the ancient text says*

**Above Entrance**:
"HERE SLEEPS THE ETERNAL HUNGER"
