## 🔹 How They Met

Encountered deep in the **Ember Vault**. Designed to prevent theft of the Codex and empowered by Varn's personal magic sigils.

## 🔹 Quest Hooks

* **"Flame Reforged"** – Someone is trying to *rebuild* the Flameguard… or *create a better version*.
* **"Soul in the Machine"** – The Flameguard murmured something before it was shut down. Was it… a name?
* **"Sigil Reversal"** – Players might use its parts to forge anti-cult defenses—or accidentally power a beacon.
