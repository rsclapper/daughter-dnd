## 🖼️ Portrait

Generated NPC-style earlier – not shown here directly but already visually designed in consistent style.

## 🔹 How They Met

Mirabel recruited the players individually and brought them to a safehouse known as **The Hollow Quill**. She claims to work for the Ember Archive and acts as their handler.

## 🔹 Quest Hooks

* **"Burned Pages"** – She's hiding a scarred page from the Codex that's reacting to one of the players.
* **"Shadows of the Archive"** – Mirabel's loyalty to the Archive is called into question when old files emerge.
* **"Mirabel's Twin"** – A dream-drowned twin may be lost in a magical vault... or already escaped it.
