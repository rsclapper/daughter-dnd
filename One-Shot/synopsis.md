A party of adventurers, summoned by the elusive Ember Archive, is tasked with infiltrating a noble masquerade in the heart of Vexler‚Äîa city divided between aristocratic opulence and rising unrest.

## üß± Structure

The one-shot is structured in **three Acts**, each with distinct paths, NPCs, maps, and pivotal player choices.

---

## üî• Act I: Planning the Heist

**Setting:** The Thieves Guild Inn, city markets, and surrounding rooftops
**Objective:** Gather information, gear up, and choose an infiltration route

### Key Events:

* Players are briefed by **Mirabel**, a charming but haunted contact from the Ember Archive.
* Party investigates three possible infiltration paths:

  * **Sewer Route** ‚Äì dangerous, but least guarded.
  * **Ballroom Masquerade** ‚Äì social infiltration during the masquerade event.
  * **Rooftop Access** ‚Äì stealth-focused, relying on urban mobility and timing.
* The party splits to scout rooftops and interact with merchants:

  * **Potion Stall** (Nike purchases invisibility potions, anti-tickle vials, etc.)
  * **Tome Merchant** (stealth-related books for the gnome, reduced prices)
  * **Weapons Stall** (guard encounter resolved diplomatically‚Äîearning a reward)
* They discover a **ranger agent** dropped a journal containing partial glyph instructions and plant-based alchemical diagrams.

**Objective:** Navigate through magical defenses and discover the vault‚Äôs entrance
